chemical sector of the multi - billion dollar agri - chemical industry . the company \\' s common stock trades under the ticker symbol usbo . pk . us biotec ( usbo ) was established to profitably develop , manufacture , market and distribute bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to agriculture , the commercial turf industry , forestry , golf courses , professional landscapers , nurseries and mass market retail lawn and garden markets . the company \\' s products are designed to rehabilitate and protect soils and plants through all natural , environmentally friendly alternatives to toxic fertilizers .\\n the founders of usbo have worked for over 15 years to produce biological chemicals or \\x94 bio - chemicals \\x94 that consistently provide results that add to the profitability of growers , while simultaneously enhancing the soil eco - system and benefiting the treated plant . the products the company has developed offer a better way to care for your crop , lawn , garden , house plants , flowers and most significantly , the environment .\\n usbo \\' s proprietary technology of combining natural chemistries with microbial components is the result of years of research with various crops , under a wide array of conditions and crop production problems , in a variety of states . as a result of this effort of product development and on - going refinement , usbo \\' s products are state - of - the - art in their ease of application and product performance . in test markets , the company \\' s products have proven to stimulate plant growth and / or increase yield by 10 % to 30 % , depending on the species treated and prevailing environmental conditions .\\n us biotec is striving to be the market leader in the bio - chemical sector of the agri - chemical marketplace that is measured world - wide in the tens of billions of dollars annually .\\n us biotec has developed a full line of biodegradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products for the agricultural , forestry , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and mass retail lawn and garden markets . us biotec \\' s ecologically friendly products can replace many of the toxic pesticides and caustic fertilizers commonly used in the agricultural industry . a second advantage beyond being environmentally friendly is that the company \\' s field studies conducted in four test markets since 1991 indicate that us biotec \\' s products can stimulate plant growth and increase vegetable crop yield by 10 % to 30 % depending on the crop and environmental conditions . us biotec plans to hire a third party to conduct independent tests to determine the precise impact the company \\' s products have on\\n crop yield .\\n by altering the concentration of natural components , such as phosphorlating compounds , enzymes , amino acids , minerals , carbohydrates , vitamins and microbes in each product , us biotec can custom design a compound for use on specific crop production problems . for example , some of us biotec \\' s products are designed to stimulate root growth and another may promote leaf growth , while another can enhance fruiting buds and yet a different product can help alleviate seasonal water stress . the different primary functions of these biotech products are achieved by altering the ratio and concentration of the common components .\\n us biotec believes that biochemical technology could revolutionize the way food is grown ! usbo \\' s products stimulate healthier plants that produce higher quantities of crops , and the company \\' s soil products help correct many microbial and mineral problems present in soils today . plus , us biotec \\' s soil biostimulants help to rehabilitate the soil ecosystem by breaking down the residual build - up of toxic insecticides , herbicides , fungicides and synthetic fertilizers , thus promoting the restoration of soil to its natural , pre - polluted state . equally as important is the fact that the company believes these biotech products are economically feasible for the majority of produce growers to purchase considering their current commodity prices .\\n us biotec \\' s products are formulated with bio - chemical components and this bio - chemical technology is not related to genetic engineering technology . us biotec \\' s biostimulants do not influence a seed \\' s gene function , but work instead to stimulate vegetative plant growth , promote fruiting sites and enhance the plant \\' s immune system function against natural enemies after germination . although , it is logical that healthier plants will produce all - around healthier seeds .\\n us biotec has already completed its research and development phase , and has formulated approximately thirty products that it believes to be commercially viable . usbo is planning to launch all of its agricultural products in the spring of 2005 , and currently plans to launch all of its existing products within 36 months of january 2005 .\\n / / / / / / / / /\\n strategy\\n \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\n us biotec \\x92 s mission is to establish itself as a profitable industry leader , pioneering the development , manufacturing , marketing and distribution of bio - degradable , non - toxic and non - carcinogenic products to the agriculture , forest , commercial turf , golf course , professional landscaping and commercial nursery industries as well as to the mass market retail lawn and garden market .\\n us biotec believes it already has a very distinct advantage over its competition because it currently has approximately 30 practical , environmentally friendly bio - chemical products ready to be introduced in various existing markets . usbo is in the process of launching its agricultural products by july 2005 . the company \\x92 s strategic plan is as follows :\\n / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\\n growth strategy\\n \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\n it is the ultimate goal of us biotec \\x92 s management team to effectively build up the company to sustained profitability while providing shareholders with competitive returns on equity . us biotec may also choose to utilize an aggressive acquisition strategy to consolidate the highly fragmented and immature bio - chemicals industry . continued funding of research development will provide two exceptional products that are some 24 - 30 months from mass marketing status .\\n / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\\n diversification strategy\\n \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\n as us biotec builds its brand name , product recognition , distribution network and reputation as the industry leader in the environmentally friendly bio - chemical solutions market , the company will simultaneously seek out other eco - friendly products to distribute .\\n as part of its growth strategy through strategic alliances , us biotec intends to distribute complementary products manufactured by other companies to applicable markets . usbo \\x92 s policy is to stay current with new products and technologies wherever and whenever reasonable and profitable . still , as the company comes across smaller companies that lack distribution capabilities or capital to market their products , but have redeeming products that are ready for market , usbo may form strategic alliances that draw upon the company \\x92 s distribution capability to increase revenues through these third party distribution agreements .\\n / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\\n marketing and sales strategy\\n \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\n us biotec understands that providing revolutionary products is not enough to guarantee the company \\x92 s financial success . this is why usbo has designed a detailed marketing and sales strategy that takes into account the unique characteristics of how the agri - chemical industry , the retail lawn and garden industry , the golf course industry , etc . operate . the company \\x92 s marketing and sales strategy may potentially include the use of teams of independent manufacturer \\x92 s representatives ( reps ) . each division picks only the best reps that possess both expertise in the science of our products and strong , established relationships with the particular customers and markets they will be targeting .\\n sales representatives in the agriculture and commercial markets will be closely supported by us biotec \\x92 s highly trained in -

- sb 18 xx ( burton ) , sb 78 xx ( polanco ) , ab 82 xx ( keeley ) and ab\\n 83 xx ( wright ) - - are still \" in play \" legislatively this evening , even though\\n the governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals\\n are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly\\n and senate to stay in session ( despite the scheduled summer break ) until a\\n bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to\\n him for signature :\\n * sb 78 xx ( polanco ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001\\n passed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes . the\\n originally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original\\n memorandum of understanding ( \" mou \" ) negotiated between governor davis and\\n southern california edison ( \" edison \" ) . it was recently amended to reflect\\n senator sher \\' s proposed \" plan b \" of the mou - - a version of the mou opposed\\n by edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy .\\n it was heard in the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on\\n wednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote . reconsideration was\\n granted , however , and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2\\n noes on thursday morning . the authors took up amendments such as striking\\n the urgency clause , changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws ,\\n placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399 . 26\\n ( which insulated edison international from certain claims ) during the\\n thursday hearing . sb 78 xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations\\n committee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes .\\n * sb 18 xx ( burton ) department of water resources : electricity : bond\\n financing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes and 2\\n noes , making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower , cheaper rate\\n than allotted in ab lx ( keeley ) assuming the assembly concurs and the bill\\n is signed by governor davis . the bill also prohibits any additional charges\\n such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and\\n requires certain \" sunshine \" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts\\n entered to by the dwr . we understand that j . p . morgan and lehman brothers\\n - - the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering - -\\n have advised the governor \\' s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of\\n the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons , so it is unclear whether\\n this bill will ever be signed . the bill was heard by the senate energy ,\\n utilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10\\n ayes and 0 noes vote . it next must be heard in the assembly .\\n * ab 82 xx ( keeley ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001\\n passed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday\\n evening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote . it was then heard later the same\\n evening by the assembly appropriations committee , where it was passed on a\\n 11 ayes and 6 noes vote . this is the \" compromise \" bill we have been\\n discussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred\\n keeley . the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this\\n report , with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by\\n the full assembly , possibly later this evening . the current version of the\\n bill provides for limited direct access , state purchase of edison \\' s\\n transmission lines for $ 2 . 4 billion , a minimum 30 percent \" haircut \" for the\\n major generators and a \" trust \" to cover all claims not dealt with by the\\n haircut option .\\n * ab 83 xx ( wright ) alternative electric utility rate stabilization act\\n of 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx ( by assembly member bill campbell ) in the\\n assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening , and then\\n passed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes . it next must be heard by\\n the assembly appropriations committee , barring a rule waiver . no such\\n committee hearing is scheduled at this time . co - authored by assembly\\n members rod wright , keith richman , joe canciamilla and bill campbell , the\\n bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address\\n the net undercollection , among other things .\\n other energy - related developments this week include :\\n * sb 84 xx ( burton ) state energy resources conservation and development\\n commission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and\\n sent to the assembly . this bill provides $ 10 million from the state general\\n fund to the california energy commission ( \" cec \" ) to fund a matching grant\\n program for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals . the grant\\n program will be administered by the cec , in consultation with local\\n governments , and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup\\n system . it next must be heard in the assembly .\\n * the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board\\n for an independent slate of directors on wednesday , the ferc announced on\\n friday . despite a dec 15 , 2000 , ferc order requiring the appointment of an\\n independent governing board for the iso , the state has refused to follow the\\n order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of\\n the board . supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees\\n should not oversee power markets due to the state \\' s domineering role in\\n purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities .\\n * sb 85 xx ( burton ) electrical restructuring : rates passed out of the\\n full senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes . this bill bars the\\n california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the\\n pre - 10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate\\n reduction period has expired on march 31 , 2002 . it next must be heard in\\n the assembly .\\n * the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to\\n investigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company\\n executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies \\'\\n trading practices . the resolution - - sr 14 - - passed out with 28 ayes and 6\\n noes .\\n * the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted\\n unanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas - based reliant\\n energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents .\\n despite reliant \\' s having handed over 10 , 000 documents , the committee\\n rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality\\n of reliant \\' s documents . the committee stepped back from its contempt vote\\n last week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to\\n agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas .\\n mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over\\n subpoenaed documents . the contempt citation against reliant will be\\n presented to the full senate , and then immediately sent to the rules\\n committee for another hearing before the full senate acts , dunn said .\\n * the state \\' s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped\\n from $ 8 . 9 billion to $ 6 . 1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment\\n in the state \\' s figure on wednesday . although the state continues to argue\\n that the $ 8 . 9 billion figure is correct , ferc judge curtis wagner called the\\n figure \" baseless \" and criticized the california delegation for \" not\\n negotiating in good faith \" during the recent settlement discussions . the\\n new amount , $ 6 . 1 billion , does not include power sales to municipal\\n utilities and alternative energy suppliers - - two entities that do not fall\\n under the purview of the iso , px or the state dwr - - as well as applies ferc\\n price controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales\\n from october 2 onward .\\n * ab 28 xx ( migden ) electrical restructuring : oversight board : iso\\n passed out of the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on\\n tuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes . it was amended by\\n the author in committee to \" double - join \" it to sb 39 xx ( see below ) . this\\n amendment \" ties \" the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx , unless\\n the double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the\\n governor for signature , assuming the bill gets to the governor .\\n * sb 39 xx ( speier ) public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly\\n energy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes .\\n reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to\\n the author . given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee , ab 28 xx is\\n effectively \" dead \" as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28 xx above . )\\n best regards ,\\n tom mcmorrow and mike martinez\\n >\\n -

( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected .\\n details , details\\n one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny \\' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . )\\n enron \\' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn \\' t done recent underwriting for enron . )\\n enron \\' s financial statements don \\' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold .\\n however , enron \\' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron \\' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter .\\n the problem is that the firm \\' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can \\' t know how much of the quarter \\' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts \\' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit .\\n partners indeed\\n the other deal that \\' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently .\\n the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron \\' s wholesale line .\\n the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results .\\n then there \\' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as \" significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . \" some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels .\\n skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ?\\n in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they \\' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million .\\n put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ?\\n an enron spokeswoman responds : \" eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . \"\\n and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott \\' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren \\' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal .\\n a person familiar with enron \\' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers .\\n this person also says the gain was \" immaterial \" to enron \\' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn \\' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn \\' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years \\' worth of mtbe - related business . what \\' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states .\\n whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay \\' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . \" they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , \" concludes off wall street \\' s roberts .\\n know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com .\\n in keeping with tsc \\' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn \\' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn \\' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships .',\n",

time quick vote ; if deal has to go to hearings - it will probably die\\n ? if not transmission deal , legislators will seize assets and seek price caps\\n ? asset seizure would target power contracts , then power plants ; as a result the endless court battles will ensue , but this gives davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers\\n ? bankruptcy for socal is still the most likely scenario , with the qfs or socal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended\\n ? congressional democrats rally around davis and seize opportunity to blame the administration\\n transmission deal and democratic support\\n as governor gray davis scrambles to build support for his socal ed . transmission proposal , one thing is evident ; the longer the deal is exposed to public debate , the less likely it is to pass . in fact , politicians have been so leery of the deal that davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the senate . in the eyes of many democratic legislators ( and all republicans ) forcing socal edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines ; that is why the governor \\' s senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick \" up or down \" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week . the bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debate , however , if there is an opening within the next two weeks and davis feels he has enough support , it will be pushed through . because the socal deal needs every piece in place as \" negotiated \" by davis \\' team , the team wants no amendments allowed on the assembly floor and a quick vote . if this unlikely fast track strategy fails for davis , the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily ( keep in mind that that it cannot even be resubmitted to the assembly until it has been vetted by socal edison attorneys ) . according to sources , the legislature is going to try to modify the memorandum of understanding between gov . davis and sce . however , the senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified mou . burton reportedly believes that at least 6 democrats will vote against it along with the republicans . the more that bill gets picked apart in public , the uglier it looks and the more democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it .\\n another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of socal and not the state . among other things , the state is overpaying by about $ 1 . 5 billion for the transmission lines . additionally , the mou davis has with socal . ed nearly matches , point for point , the deal davis condemned with pg & e .\\n asset seizures\\n since before the pg & e bankruptcy filing , we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly frustrated democrats . davis \\' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across california to existing power contracts negotiated by , whom davis \\' s calls , \" profiteering power brokers \" . of course , everyone in the governor \\' s office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts , and would be a legal nightmare ( there are a few minor constitutional , legal and interstate commerce problems ) . the main thing is that the seizing would continue davis \\' s main approach to this problem - - management by press conference - - and it would put the governor and democrats on the right side of the issue - - punishing the capitalist leeches . according to one senior democratic legislator , there is movement within democratic members of the state assembly to demand that davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase . of course , taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants . the appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put california state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce mark - ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spot - market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof .\\n price caps\\n one strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three republican governors from colorado , alaska and wyoming . these three were the key players during the portland western governor \\' s conference last january and , according to senior white house officials , it took the personal and prolonged intervention of president bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors . \" if they had signed that price cap appeal , \" the administration source said , \" we would already have price caps . so if they start to make it clear something has changed , we will have to listen . \" sources indicate that if these republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps , the bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the west .\\n cost plus caps - - think of these as republican price caps in that their first duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid . just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal , current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like $ 250 per kilowatt hour . that is a long way down from the august futures contract that is pricing in $ 750 per kilowatt hour , but a long way above last august \\' s $ 150 / kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power , which is something like $ 25 - 30 / kwh .\\n market - price exceptions - - the option allows the bush administration to have political credit for imposing price caps . as we write , ferc is currently , in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in california ( duke , dynegy , aes , reliant and williams ) . the permit grants a further three - year waiver that allows them to sell power into california in the existing \" whatever price the market will bear \" . in other words , ferc could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price , perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share , and then power to control prices would revert back to ferc .\\n technically , in granting the extension of these permits , ferc has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield \" market power \" - - that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times . of course , ferc has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes . but that would mean ferc would have to want to wield effective power over price capping in california and they have shown no desire on that front . the escape clause for ferc simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than 20 % of an electricity market and none of these companies come close .\\n in other words , the waivers option lets ferc escape if the bush administration and ferc commissioners really want to escape . once again , that decision may be more in the hands of the three republican governors than anywhere else in the country . but you can be certain that in the past few days administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants .\\n democrats seize opportunity to blame bush\\n senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as $ 60 billion , which would destroy state finances for a decade . add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out - of - pocket electricity costs ( they paid $ 7 billion for electricity in 1999 , $ 27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay $ 70 billion this year - - ten times the rate two years ago . then , of course , they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way , and , well , who can blame the democrats for saying there is a simple solution , but the white house won \\' t allow it .\\n national level democrats realize california \\' s power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the bush administration and its free - market advocate , ferc chairman hebert , over their resistance to summer price caps . as california \\' s leaders calculate this year \\' s taxpayer energy bill at potentially $ 60 billion , a rogue \\' s gallery of democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with governor davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message : \" the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in washington dc , at ferc headquarters controlled by bush administration appointees . \" and as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the us congress comes more into focus , the solutions articulated by california \\' s democrats who sense they have republicans on the run in the west become less and less \" free market \" focused . the two strains of the democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps .',\n",

term contracts with 5 . 5\\n cent cap and ( 2 ) creation of california power and conservation financing\\n authority\\n the long - term contracts proposed in ab - 1 x are likely to be subject to\\n significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb . 2 nd expiration of\\n sb - 7 x .\\n the authority proposed in sb - 6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance\\n new generation capacity and conservation measures\\n negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility\\n bailout - - utilities and state government split over debt obligations of\\n utility parents\\n state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state\\n treasury ; socal edison misses more payments\\n bush administration opposes price caps , but is supporting state efforts to\\n split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or\\n issue\\n bonds to deal with the rest .\\n as one very senior california political leader explained , getting the utility\\n holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves\\n is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread\\n public outrage about a \" bailout \" of private price - gouging companies with\\n taxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and\\n the puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial\\n political stance for the governor .\\n but , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a\\n shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches\\n of the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite\\n willing to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both\\n sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court\\n that would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country \\' s economy\\n would\\n suffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor \\' s political future would\\n suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a\\n bankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the\\n utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during\\n bankruptcy\\n procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of\\n the debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state\\n government\\n determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in\\n a major way .\\n senator burton \\' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically\\n to make this point quite explicit . it would set up a \" california power and\\n conservation\\n financing authority , \" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent\\n domain . it would finance new power plants , and \" consider the feasibility and\\n public\\n interest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission\\n facilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . \"\\n as we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the\\n bankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has\\n shifted\\n in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to \" maybe we \\' ve run this thing\\n out as far as we can . \" but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is\\n still quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off\\n over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities \\'\\n holding\\n company is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it\\n possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate\\n accelerated payment .\\n 5 . default update - thursday\\n socal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange .\\n after edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the\\n california power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling\\n them to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects\\n its trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today ,\\n leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources .\\n while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e \\' s and socal \\' s\\n ability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to\\n pick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term .\\n the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed\\n california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3\\n billion from the state general fund in advance of this year \\' s expected fiscal\\n surplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future\\n revenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is\\n unclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of\\n repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating\\n agencies .\\n 5 . bush policies\\n as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate\\n little interest in getting involved in the california crisis .\\n president - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments ,\\n which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root\\n of the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be\\n unanimously opposed to long - term price caps .\\n however , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration ,\\n according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is\\n significant concern that pg & e \\' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to\\n stop shipments of gas through pg & e \\' s pipeline . the risk would be that the\\n pipeline could \" go dry \" , causing significant and possibly dangerous\\n disruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this\\n problem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate\\n gas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the\\n electric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant\\n defaults .',\n",

trading companies .\\n investors appeared worried that enron \\' s recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy - trading market . the houston energy powerhouse , with annualized revenue topping $ 150 billion and assets of more than $ 60 billion , handles transactions representing roughly one - quarter of the nation \\' s traded - electricity and natural - gas volumes . in less than two years of operation , its enrononline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $ 880 billion in transactions .\\n \" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , \" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . \" there \\' s not a trader out there that doesn \\' t use enrononline . \" as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company \\' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid .\\n enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company \\' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company \\' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow \\' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions .\\n while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company \\' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive \\' s departure . \" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , \" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement .\\n enron said mr . fastow \" will be on a leave of absence from the company . \" he couldn \\' t be reached for comment .\\n it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow \\' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron \\' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board \\' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock .\\n enron \\' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share .\\n in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron \\' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles .\\n prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow \\' s departure could be seen as evidence that \" management does care \" about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as \" an admission of guilt . \" ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company \\' s extremely complex financial structure .\\n enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings .\\n worries and rumors about enron \\' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible \" death spiral \" in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn \\' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem .\\n however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with \" trust and credibility . it \\' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , \" he said .\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c\\n enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings\\n by floyd norris\\n 10 / 25 / 2001\\n the new york times\\n page 2 , column 5\\n c . 2001 new york times company\\n the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission .\\n \\' \\' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , \\' \\' kenneth l . lay , enron \\' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board \\' \\' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . \\' \\'\\n the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron \\' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer .\\n enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night .\\n the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron \\' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it .\\n on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions .\\n the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron \\' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand .\\n by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address .\\n concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company \\' \\' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , \\' \\' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate .\\n mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 .\\n according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow \\' s successor , was enron \\' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said .\\n shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 .\\n one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to \\' \\' sell \\' \\' from \\' \\' hold . \\' \\' she had lowered the rating to \\' \\' hold \\' \\' from \\' \\' buy \\' \\' on monday .\\n \\' \\' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , \\' \\' she said in an interview yesterday evening , \\' \\' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street . \\' \\'\\n but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way . \\' \\' people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you \\' ll never get any answers . \\' \\'\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n financial\\n pressured enron ousts cfo\\n 10 / 25 / 2001\\n the washington post\\n final\\n eo 2\\n copyright 2001 , the washington post co . all rights reserved\\n enron replaced andrew fastow as its chief financial officer , a day after chief executive kenneth lay stressed the company \\' s confidence in fastow , who performed dual roles as the energy giant \\' s cfo while managing partnerships with which enron did business . \" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , \" lay said in a statement . the partnerships have been dissolved .\\n http : / / www . washingtonpost . com\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n oct . 25 , 2001 , 12 : 06 am\\n houston chronicle\\n enron replaces cfo to reassure investors\\n by laura goldberg\\n copyright 2001 houston chronicle\\n in a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on wall street , houston - based enron corp . removed its chief financial officer wednesday , as federal securities regulators review business dealings between enron and two investment partnerships that he ran .\\n enron , the world \\' s largest energy trader , said chief financial officer andrew fastow had been put on a \" leave of absence \" for an undetermined period and named another enron executive , jeff mcmahon , as his replacement . the company said the move was not a reflection on fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper .\\n \" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , \" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares .\\n enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street \\' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 .\\n the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron \\' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships -

off .\\n that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third -

z , there is not a solid plan to save this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may come to fruition .\\n over the last few days , edison executives have begun pointing hard at the cpuc meeting this friday as a make - or - break event for the company . the is because after the meeting , davis \\' s mou plan to buy socal \\' s grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy . this plan is essentially dead although governor daivs has yet to say this in a press releases . the final nail will happen after the cpuc adjourns its friday meeting without voting on several necessary mou provisions . unless the cpuc makes a last minute , emergency - amendment to their agenda , the deal will be dead ( despite socal \\' s support for letting the deal stand past its deadline ) . sources indicate that cpuc president loretta lynch holds reservations on the mou and continues to distance herself from davis .\\n attempting to influence policy making , edison executives have spent the last few investor phone conferences warning that june 8 would see substantially increased risks for a creditor - induced bankruptcy if the davis plan dies at cpuc . this is interesting , since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until edison began mentioning it late last week . however , there is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks . as reported several times earlier , most everyone had given up on the mou long before this friday \\' s cpuc meeting .\\n plan z shows little progress\\n meanwhile , the unhurried pace toward a plan z that we reported last friday , has gained little progress . legislators continue to pin - point a plan that will secure re - election votes and at the same time , weigh the need for rate hikes for california \\' s corporate and home electricity users . as they hash it out , the state is spending even more on electricity purchases . in spite of better than expected levels of conservation , the state \\' s electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $ 79 m / day . the recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question the reassuring angelides scenario for california \\' s budget prospects later this year .\\n the california budget crunch\\n even more worrisome than a idle plan z is increasing evidence that last month \\' s conference call with state treasurer angelides was a little misleading . during that conference call angelides claimed that state comptroller connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong . angelides argued that $ 7 . 2 b already spent to buy power since january was really the total amount of authorized spending through late august . in fact , he said only $ 4 . 3 b of that had been \" spent . \" sources now indicate that angelides was technically correct if you use \" spent \" to mean only the amount of money for which checks had been written . this is different than the amount of money california had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supplied energy to the state . in fact , when angelides was speaking the state had in fact already promised to pay $ 7 b for energy it had already consumed ( the total committed has topped $ 8 b . ) by the time the state gets its \" power bonds \" auctioned in august , they will have already spent all $ 12 b and be back to dipping into the general fund . the idea of rans being auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund doesn \\' t make it to august .\\n the nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance . then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid . the only near term path to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3 , 500 mw from qf plants which are off line because of cash flow problems . settling their needs is wrapped up in settling the pg & e and edison trade creditor issues , which makes the legislature \\' s leisurely approach to the rate hike / haircut situation all the more troublesome .\\n energy relief\\n the house energy & commerce committee is scheduled to vote on h . r . 1647 ( the emergency electricity relief act ) tomorrow at 10 : 00 am . the bill which was twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps , but during the course of the mark - up , sources indicate that it is possible , even likely , that a democrat could offer a price cap amendment . rep . waxman ( d - ca ) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark - up of the bill at the subcommittee level . the waxman amendment was rejected along party lines ( all republicans and 2 democrats voted nay ) . sources inside joe barton \\' s office report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on the price cap issue , but nothing has been resolved . as of this afternoon , those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the committee tomorrow . since an agreement was not reached , compromise language is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow . if it is , it would not be something that leaders on the republican and democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass . sources indicate that the committee does expect waxman , and possibly others to offer price cap language , but it is not expected to pass .',\n",

charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\n\\nsally\\n i just want to summarize / clarify our discussions so far on the commercial\\n support model for enron japan .\\n my background :\\n in europe the commercial support function was divided into a middle office\\n ( mo ) and a back office ( bo ) part , with a european controller ( fearnley dyson )\\n responsible for both functions . for scandinavia , the only trading office in\\n europe outside of london , i was responsible for both functions , as local\\n office controller , reporting into barry pearce , who reported to fearnley . in\\n japan i also have this local office controller function , as being responsible\\n for mo / bo activities in this region . the mo would consist of the trading\\n related functions : documentation ( capture & confirmation ) , risk management ,\\n settlement and trade accounting . the bo would consist of g & a ' s , salaries &\\n wages , tax , management reporting , statutory reporting and vat .\\n back office :\\n i report directly to cassandra scultz ( vp & cao of enron apachi ) . as much as\\n possible are to be outsourced to our sydney office ( heidi mason , who also\\n reports to cassandra ) , but some work has to be done in tokyo . the reasons for\\n this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the power point presentation\\n enclosed below . for payments we use houston treasury , as they are the only\\n ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems .\\n middle office :\\n mandate\\n what i have in writing is a section from joe hirl ' s memo ( request for japan\\n power trading positions ( draft ) ) to rick buy and greg whalley dated april 19\\n this year ( please find enclosed )\\n back office operations : jan erland bekeng in cooperation with sally beck\\n will look to establish the local risk books in tokyo and define any\\n system modifications necessary given the characteristics of the japanese\\n electricity market . enron japan will handle trade capture and risk\\n management while confirmations and settlements will occur in houston under\\n sally beck \\x01 , s supervision . it support and system modification will be\\n overseen by anthony dayao and performed in houston .\\n discussion - current & future situation\\n i see more commodities than power . metals will arrive september 25 , weather\\n is on the way from sydney , and garry hickerson will from september 1 have a\\n guy here doing irfx , agri and maybe equity . we are also looking into oil\\n deals , and have plans for gas , coal , pulp & paper , credit and emissions . also\\n ebs is on the way . i only see metals , irfx and weather as active desks this\\n year , maybe oil . power will take some more time to get active , due to the\\n very closed market situation here right now . on the origination side we might\\n see some structures / cross commidity / finance deals go through . thus we have a\\n mix of activites from enron apachi , enron global markets , ebs and enron\\n metals . basically everyone wants to do some business in japan .\\n to coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient ,\\n independent , segregated , automised and service minded japanese commercial\\n support function possible . to accomplish these objectives , outsourcing to\\n sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately , and is\\n highly recommended from our side . labour costs in sydney is 25 % of the costs\\n in tokyo . due to sydney ' s experience and size they are ready to expand and\\n take on this project . they already have the segregation and independence in\\n place , and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of being\\n an intermideary between tokyo and houston . bilingual staff would be hired to\\n perform japanese services , which is widely available in sydney . and there is\\n only one hour in difference between us . outsourcing these activities from\\n japan to australia is a growing trend , and many large corporations have done\\n it this way .\\n there will be some time from the first trades until functions and commodities\\n are moved to sydney . tokyo want and needs to learn , understand all details ,\\n automise , make routines and calibrate systems first . on the confirmation side\\n our legal department would be heavily involved in th start , compared to later\\n stages .\\n proposed mo structure for enron japan\\n a ) responsibility for all commercial support activities in japan to be\\n sourced to enron japan , under enron japan ' s cfo .\\n b ) outsource programmable tasks to sydney :\\n - documentation ( capture & confirmation )\\n - settlement\\n - trade accounting\\n c ) risk management in tokyo .\\n i look forward to hear from you .\\n regards\\n jan - erland\",\n",

day mediation session . although not unexpected , but still disappointing , the judge endorses the market design proposal of the new york and new england isos . this market design proposal encompasses a long , drawn out process for discussing what the northeast market should look like ( minimum 12 months ) before work begins to develop the new rto . the target implementation date of the isos is november , 2004 , but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is \" subject to extension \" if new design requirements are introduced . we believe the true intent of the isos is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing iso structures . a copy of the judge \\' s report and the business plan are attached .\\n one good aspect of the judge \\' s report is that he asks in several areas of the report for commission guidance . we too believe this is necessary . it became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the new york entities ( or the new england iso ) on market design or governance . we argued that ferc intended the new market design to be primarily the pjm system , with enhancements where possible . others , relying on the ambiguity in ferc \\' s orders , argued that ferc really intended to create a new system , using pjm as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two isos , regardless of time or complication of creating this new market . we need ferc direction on this , and the judge makes this clear .\\n background\\n the judge \\' s primary goal of this 45 - day mediation process was simply to establish a \" business plan \" which lays out how and when a single northeast rto will be created . enron , along with many other participants , opposed this approach , arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the commission . the judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly . although the majority of the judge \\' s report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan , he does discuss two substantive issues : market design and governance .\\n market design\\n at the beginning of the mediation , pjm , ny and ne submitted a joint proposal for forming a single northeast rto . this proposal envisions a time - intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders , with an implementation date in 3 - 4 years ( \" option 1 - m \" of the business plan ) . this proposal is now supported by the new england and new york isos - pjm has its own approach ( see below ) . the new york transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new rto in 3 years ( \" option 2 - m \" of the business plan ) . pjm submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single northeast rto with a single day - ahead and real - time energy market by november 2003 ( \" option 3 - m \" of the business plan ) .\\n we took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers , generators , pjm tos , industrials , and other end use customers ( the one rto coalition ) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on pjm \\' s system by december 2002 , but no later than may , 2003 . although we ( enron ) believe pjm \\' s november 2003 time frame is too conservative , the coalition supports option 3 - m ( pjm \\' s approach ) since it achieves the coalition \\' s goals , albeit on a slower timetable .\\n as noted above , the judge endorses option 1 - m , in part because it has a built - in a process for determining \" best practices . \" although pjm also conducted a \" best practices \" analysis , the other isos and ny tos do not agree with pjm \\' s determinations of what practices from their isos are \" best practices . \"\\n the judge acknowledges that support for option 3 - m ( the pjm plan ) \" far outstrips \" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support . however , the judge believes that the pjm option assumes the pjm platform can work in new york and new england , even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in new york and new england than in pjm . the judge states that \" impatience , haste and greed \" should not be permitted to drive the rto process \" at the expense of sound policy \" and that optimal rto benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to \" exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint . \" see report , page 18 .\\n governance\\n the other substantive issues we have discussed are governance : interim governance , final governance , board make - up and stakeholder process . the judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead , he discusses the pros and cons of each option . here again , the judge strongly urges the commission to provide guidance to the participants on the commission \\' s preferred governance approach . the judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures .\\n pjm has stated that in order to meet its deadline of november 2003 ( and certainly earlier ) , pjm has to be in control of the implementation of the new rto . pjm proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing isos : 5 from pjm , 3 from new york , and 2 from new england . the board elects a voting ceo ( assumed to be phil harris if the pjm proposal wins ) .\\n ny iso , new england iso , ny psc , ny tos and new england tos , along with other entities ( primarily those who are afraid to cross new york psc ) all support equal representation on the new board . one proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with a non - voting ceo . the other proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders .\\n we support the pjm board make - up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single northeast rto and energy market based on the pjm system .\\n post mediation\\n the judge in his report recommends that the commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge .\\n the judge urges the commission to not accept comments from participants , but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment . we are working on two sets of comments now , one on our own and one in conjunction with the one rto coalition . we will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared .\\n although we are disappointed that the judge did not endorse the pjm proposal , we still believe that the commission is intent on implementing a single northeast rto as soon as possible and that the pjm proposal provides a well - reasoned ( even conservative ) approach to reaching that goal . therefore , even though the judge sided with new york , we are hopeful that the commission will stick to its guns and go with the pjm proposal .\\n please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the report .\\n sarah , dan , howard and tom',\n",

charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\n\\nif you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .\\n bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support\\n sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly \" unwilling to fight \" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would \" double dip \" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .\\n the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \" eat \" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor \\' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .\\n currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen \\' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .\\n according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .\\n key points of the bridge financing\\n initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b\\n lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b\\n lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b\\n bear stearns $ 625 m\\n tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt\\n projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %\\n tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %\\n current projected\\n blended ir : 5 . 38 %\\n maturity date : august 29 , 2001\\n for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510\\n bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time\\n the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .\\n socal edison and bankruptcy\\n at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .\\n the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .',\n",

refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan\\n adopt market mechanisms ( rather than imposing rigid price controls ) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs\\n promote conservation and demand response\\n please see details below .\\n june 12 , 2001\\n the honorable curt h\\n ? bert , jr .\\n chairman\\n federal energy regulatory commission\\n 888 first street , ne\\n washington dc , 20426\\n dear chairman h ? bert :\\n since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely\\n monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west\\n continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and\\n california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again\\n this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west ,\\n including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that\\n the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity\\n prices and keep power flowing into california .\\n we recognize the commission \\' s efforts in recent months to address the\\n electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures\\n to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are\\n pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout\\n the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale\\n electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the\\n entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are\\n just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the\\n commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices\\n in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a\\n comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor\\n wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market\\n participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) .\\n specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale\\n electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the\\n wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and\\n failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds\\n that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it\\n should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the\\n full extent allowed by law .\\n aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon\\n market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would\\n exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share\\n the commission \\' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply .\\n accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution ,\\n the commission \\' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as\\n appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging\\n availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission .\\n to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the\\n commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote\\n conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states\\n where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less\\n incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a\\n substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can\\n encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity .\\n such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both\\n wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices ,\\n \" foregone \" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume .\\n specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale\\n \" clearinghouse \" for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers ,\\n whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone\\n power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers .\\n we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand\\n reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable\\n sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we\\n understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state\\n laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant\\n consumers .\\n we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission \\' s previous\\n efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for\\n consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure\\n maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you\\n take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as\\n possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not\\n later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions\\n please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with\\n this request .\\n sincerely ,\\n w . j . \" billy \" tauzin\\n chairman\\n committee on energy and commerce\\n joe barton\\n chairman\\n subcommittee on energy and air quality\\n heather wilson\\n member\\n committee on energy and commerce\\n george radanovich\\n member\\n committee on energy and commerce\\n mary bono\\n member\\n committee on energy and commerce\\n greg walden\\n member\\n committee on energy and commerce\\n william m . thomas\\n jerry lewis\\n duncan hunter\\n randy \" duke \" cunningham\\n ken calvert\\n stephen horn\\n edward r . royce\\n doug ose\\n darrell e . issa',\n",

based enron ,\\n based on filings with the texas secretary of state .\\n the foreign business corporations and limited liability\\n companies have directors , officers or managers whose address is\\n listed as 1400 smith street in houston , enron \\' s corporate address ,\\n according to texas records .\\n fastow is listed as a director , officer or managing member in\\n each one . at least one of the companies bought and sold enron\\n assets , including foreign power plants .\\n whitewing management , which lists fastow as its managing\\n member , received $ 807 million from the sale of enron debt last\\n year .\\n under the terms of the debt sale , whitewing is allowed to use\\n the proceeds to buy power plants from enron or make other\\n ` ` permitted investments . \\' \\' whitewing has bought 14 enron plants or\\n companies since 1999 and sold four .\\n enron \\' s denne has not responded to written requests about\\n fastow \\' s role at whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the\\n value of enron assets to benefit outside investors or company\\n executives at enron \\' s expense .\\n shares of enron fell $ 2 . 95 to $ 26 . 05 . they have fallen\\n 69 percent this year .\\n -

enron corp . stock sustained further heavy losses on friday as investor confidence in the former wall street favorite was rocked by reports about the company \\' s relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by enron \\' s chief financial officer .\\n the energy giant \\' s stock closed down $ 2 . 95 or 10 . 2 percent at $ 26 . 05 per share , making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which enron reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in over four years .\\n analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the wall street journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from enron .\\n \" i don \\' t think this thing passes the smell test , \" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity . \" i think the cfo should be out of there right now . in the interest of the stockholders , that cfo should be gone , \" he said .\\n enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements , but fastow severed his ties with the ljm 2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities .\\n poor judgment ?\\n analysts said that at the very least , the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at enron , which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high - profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer jeff skilling in august .\\n \" for a company that had a lot of question marks around it already , these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors , \" said commerzbank securities analyst andre meade . \" it points to poor decision - making on behalf of the board and top management at enron , \" he said .\\n enron , north america \\' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity , was one of wall street \\' s high flyers last year , when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent .\\n the stock \\' s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company \\' s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its enrononline internet energy trading platform .\\n this year enron \\' s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the internet soured , skilling resigned after only six months as ceo , and the company \\' s dabhol power plant project in india became mired in a payments dispute .\\n moody \\' s investors service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron \\' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after enron took $ 1 . 01 billion in write - downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non - core businesses , including broadband and water services .\\n some of enron \\' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings .\\n analysts said enron \\' s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the ljm 2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead .\\n \" what don \\' t we know that went on at that company ? where \\' s the credibility ? \" asked one frustrated analyst . \" we don \\' t know if it \\' s limited to this , \" he said .\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n enron corp . cut to ` hold \\' at a . g . edwards\\n 2001 -

charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\n\\nhigh prices force chemicals to sell gas , futures\\n chemical companies , forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas\\n prices , are nevertheless making money - - - by selling gas futures contracts .\\n terra industries and mississippi chemical corp . became the latest companies\\n to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs .\\n iowa - based terra industries said it had sold off a portion of its december\\n natural gas purchases , and shutdown 50 % of its verdigis , ok , ammonia\\n facility . the company had previously reported that it would not operate its\\n bytheville , ar , and beaumont , tx , facilities during the month of december as\\n well .\\n in a similar maneuver , mississippi chemical corp . , a producer of nitrogen ,\\n phosphorus and potassium - based products in mississippi , louisiana and new\\n mexico , reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from\\n january forward , in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered\\n by soaring natural gas prices . mississippi chemical said it expects to\\n realize a pre - tax gain of $ 16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending\\n dec . 31 from the recently sold contracts .\\n the problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being\\n mimicked by chemical prices . an overabundance on the market has kept chemical\\n prices relatively low , while gas prices , a feedstock for some chemicals ,\\n continue to climb . the difference in the latest shutdowns is that the\\n companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts\\n off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products , said ron\\n phillips of the fertilizer institute .\\n duke energy \\' s ken nyiri , divisional director of strategic planning and\\n research , commented on mississippi chemical \\' s transactions , \" i guess they\\n probably made about a $ 4 / mmbtu margin on the gas , which is significantly more\\n than they could make on the ammonia ; in fact , they would have lost $ 30 / unit .\\n their ammonia was probably costing them about $ 205 / ton to make ( with gas\\n bought at $ 5 / mmbtu in november ) and the market today is at $ 205 so basically\\n they would break even on their ammonia production costs . by selling the gas\\n at around $ 9 / mmbtu they made $ 4 / mmbtu . it was just a question of do they\\n convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it , or do they sell the gas\\n and make $ 16 million . \"\\n michael l . bennett , executive vice president of terra , said , \" the natural gas\\n price increase since our december requirements were purchased for verdigris\\n permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross\\n profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with\\n the natural gas . we will evaluate the economics of bringing verdigris back to\\n full production near the end of december when january \\' s natural gas purchase\\n commitments must be made . \"\\n terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40 % , 30 % , 77 % and 88 % of the\\n company \\' s north american ammonia , uan , urea and methanol manufacturing\\n capacity , respectively . the production of all four chemicals are heavily\\n dependent on natural gas . phillips said \" the latest data we had in october\\n was that of the companies that we survey , which is not the entire ammonia\\n market , but a good bit of it , we were looking at operating rates of 76 % . \"\\n currently , a total of 4 - 5 million tons / year of ammonia production capacity is\\n out of service out of about 20 - 21 million tons / year of production capacity .\\n \" clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [ rather than\\n producing ammonia ] , \" said nyiri . \" it \\' s the prudent thing to do , i think , in\\n this marketplace . buy your ammonia if you can . at $ 9 gas , that costs you\\n $ 350 / ton to make the ammonia , which is $ 145 more than the current market is\\n willing to pay . \"\\n a spokeswoman for mississippi chemical said the company held on to its\\n december gas contracts , and has been operating at varied levels of capacity\\n throughout 2000 ( see daily gpi , june 30 ) . \" depending on what the gas prices\\n are , and what our product prices are around the january - february time frame ,\\n we will make decisions then on our operations rate [ capacity ] , \" said melinda\\n hood , a mississippi chemical spokeswoman .\\n charles o . dunn , ceo of mississippi chemical , said , \" we remain committed to\\n the nitrogen business and our customers , but we also have to take advantage\\n of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times . it is\\n our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to\\n be sustained during the intermediate term , \" stated dunn . \" as a result , we\\n felt it was in the company \\' s best interest to sell our futures positions to\\n lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas\\n prices . going forward , we will continue to determine operating levels for our\\n plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices , nitrogen product\\n prices and our customers \\' requirements , as we have been doing for some time . \"\\n international imports are also hurting u . s . producers . currently , there is a\\n surplus of ammonia in the international market , which is holding ammonia\\n prices down . u . s . fertilizer producers can \\' t compete with the international\\n market . gas prices are 46 cents / mmbtu in russia , 50 cents to $ 1 / mmbtu in\\n argentina and venezuela , and $ 1 / mmbtu in trinidad . the u . s . imports 5 . 5\\n million tons of ammonia each year . fertilizers represent 80 % of the demand\\n for ammonia in the united states .\\n terra industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it\\n became economical again - - - whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and\\n methanol prices rising , just as long as \" prices reach levels allowing\\n positive cash flows . \"\\n nyiri said he believes relief is in sight . he pointed out that the ammonia\\n market has been sitting around the $ 205 / ton level for the last several\\n months , but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next\\n planting season . \" i \\' ve got my model peaking out around $ 250 / ton in april or\\n may and at that time i have gas costs coming down . \" at that point , the 1 - 2\\n bcf / d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin\\n returning to service .\\n - -',\n",

up from our conversation last week . i appreciate your responses , and\\n will follow - up as needed .\\n just to recap eim \\' s current inititives .\\n  ( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan\\n for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical\\n business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a \" blueprint \" of eim major\\n processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics ,\\n settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the\\n initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the\\n \" blueprint \" , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and\\n recommended systems . a complete \" roadmap \" should be laid out with a\\n 0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan\\n addresses tactical also .\\n our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and\\n systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the\\n current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional\\n industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little\\n change to support new industries .\\n the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we \\' d be happy to visit with\\n you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let\\n me know how to proceed .\\n thanks again for your time . since i wasn \\' t able to attend the controllers \\'\\n conference last 10 / 00 , i \\' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch .\\n brenda\\n to : brenda f herod / hou / ect @ ect\\n cc : mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , paul wallace / lon / ect @ ect\\n subject : metals\\n brenda\\n as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality\\n between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals .\\n in particular i promised info on a few areas :\\n project q assessment\\n a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals\\n ( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues\\n which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were :\\n q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less\\n complex than oil & coal .\\n metals process tends towards buy > store > sell whereas for liquids the storage\\n is not as prevelant\\n metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge\\n 2 . inventory controls\\n again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul\\n wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on\\n developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul\\n directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in\\n general .\\n 3 . funding of inventory\\n we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to\\n enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are\\n the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured\\n financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either\\n david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro\\n to the issues faced .\\n 4 . curve management process\\n the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme\\n curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and\\n location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by\\n brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with\\n 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6\\n for the far east ) . the maintaince & price testing of the grids is made\\n manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port\\n groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points\\n i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a\\n market quote .\\n 5 . re recruitment of paper traders\\n i haven \\' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david\\n rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced\\n paper .\\n i \\' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london .\\n i \\' d appreciate same for eim .\\n regards\\n andy',\n",

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ?\\n the answer is far from easy .\\n ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand .\\n just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities .\\n one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets .\\n by enron \\' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services .\\n wholesale services houses the company \\' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron \\' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today .\\n not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk .\\n enron energy services is the company \\' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division .\\n enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock .\\n in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division .\\n but enron \\' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants .\\n through enron \\' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things .\\n what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company \\' s financial structure .\\n enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn \\' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations .\\n without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company \\' s value are missing .\\n also , much still remains unknown about the company \\' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles .\\n using what is known about enron \\' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation .\\n merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n enron \\' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation\\n by juan . a . lozano\\n associated press writer\\n 10 / 31 / 2001\\n associated press newswires\\n copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .\\n houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover .\\n shares of enron , the nation \\' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago .\\n carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday \\' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron \\' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover .\\n others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said .\\n on tuesday , enron \\' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 .\\n enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one -

u . s . energy traders such as dynegy inc . and aquila inc . have taken a knock as a result of enron corp \\' s recent woes , but analysts do not expect a broad loss of investor confidence in the sector to trigger massive losses in stock prices like enron has suffered .\\n \" the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , \" said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . \" i don \\' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , \" he said .\\n enron \\' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company \\' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks .\\n and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said .\\n \" enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , \" said prudential securities analyst carole coale .\\n uncomfortable with disclosure\\n coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron \\' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron \\' s profits .\\n el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants .\\n analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron .\\n el paso \\' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company \\' s earnings .\\n dynegy \\' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy \\' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors \\' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio .\\n asked about dynegy \\' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any \" related party transactions \" .\\n former high - fliers shunned\\n analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies \\' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines .\\n in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks .\\n on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an \" asset - light \" philosophy .\\n williams \\' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke \\' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market .\\n j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface .\\n \" enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn \\' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , \" he said .\\n credit lyonnais securities \\' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was .\\n \" trading companies have always had a history of winning big and losing big , \" he said . \" i think the days of the big valuations are over , \" he added .\\n copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\n waste management will start pulp and paper trading tomorrow\\n 2001 -

called 10 - q filings , along\\n with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year .\\n not much publicity\\n by then , statistics about the companies \\' assets , liabilities\\n and shareholders \\' equity , the accounting terms for what \\' s owned ,\\n what \\' s owed and what \\' s left over , will be rather outdated .\\n u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter\\n to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year\\n for 10 - k reports .\\n these filings usually don \\' t arrive until weeks after the\\n publication of earnings releases . so it \\' s easy to overlook the\\n additional information they provide , especially when it doesn \\' t\\n receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does .\\n yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that\\n omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that\\n investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at\\n their own peril .\\n enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in\\n ` ` non - recurring \\' \\' costs in the third quarter from an expansion\\n into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the\\n expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter .\\n these numbers were part of the houston - based company \\' s income\\n statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or\\n losses during a specified time period . income statements are the\\n cornerstone of any company \\' s earnings release .\\n billion - dollar numbers\\n the release didn \\' t even mention a larger figure that affected\\n the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders \\' equity\\n during the quarter resulting from the company \\' s repurchase of 55\\n million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co -\\n investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who\\n ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial\\n officer last week .\\n chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a\\n subsequent conference call .\\n such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors \\' fortunes .\\n since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron \\' s shares\\n have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the\\n low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 .\\n enron \\' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on\\n ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity \\' \\' which\\n contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that\\n item was later put at $ 35 million .\\n the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall\\n figure for ` ` non -

' '\\n mccorkle said the aug . 2 incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power . that left the western grid - - a vast network of high - voltage lines , transformers and other electrical gear that spans 14 states and parts of canada and mexico - - with a sudden and severe electrical shortage . if uncorrected , she and others said , it could have led to widespread power outages .\\n although officials need to keep the grid ' s electrical frequency at 60 hertz , the aug . 2 shortage lowered it to 59 . 93 hertz . state officials said blackouts could occur at 59 . 65 hertz .\\n mccorkle declined to name the companies involved . but patrick dorinson , a spokesman for mirant , which has three plants in the bay area , said it was partly responsible . while offering few details about what happened , he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee ` ` not making a timely call ' ' and ` ` some software problems with our computers . ' '\\n ` ` it happens , ' ' dorinson said . ` ` people make mistakes . ' '\\n an official with the federal energy regulatory commission , one of the agencies investigating the matter , said it views the aug . 2 incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesn ' t happen again . the agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order . but at this point , the official said , it ' s unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion , incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices .\\n the official said the agency also wants to know why the california independent system operator didn ' t declare a statewide emergency on aug . 2 when the promised electricity wasn ' t delivered . had it done so , he said , the agency would have had more leverage over the generators .\\n some power company representatives complained that the iso doesn ' t always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs . for many plants , ` ` it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to ramp up , ' ' said richard wheatley , a spokesman with reliant energy of houston . ` ` you physically can ' t do it . ' '\\n but iso officials defended their procedures , and spokesman gregg fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on aug . 2 wouldn ' t have been feasible .\\n ` ` this was so quick , ' ' he said . ` ` it was less than half an hour total from start to finish , and we were able to deal with it appropriately ' ' without suffering blackouts .\\n the incident also is being looked into by the western systems coordinating council , a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials , which sets rules for managing grids in the region ' s nearly 1 . 8 million square miles .\\n robert dintelman , the agency ' s assistant executive director , said brief electricity fluctuations , such as the one that hit california or worse , occur once or twice a month across the west . on aug . 1 , for example , the frequency dipped to 59 . 75 in montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there , dintelman said .\\n but he said california ' s claim that generators aren ' t following orders is unusual . ` ` that is alarming , ' ' he added .\\n the council can issue fines for some rule violations . but dintelman said he ' s not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power .\\n nationally , such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak , said ellen vancko of the north american electric reliability council . her group has been pushing congress to make the system tougher , but the legislation has stalled . meanwhile , she said , grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide .\\n although the motivation for these incidents varies , she said , sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves , ` ` even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at risk .

it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , \" i lost 15 pounds \" or \" i quit smoking . \" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying \" they \" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n\\'t you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n\\'t even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n\\'t . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n\\'t have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won\\'t hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n\\'t feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .',\n",

it seems that most people that are selling cd \\'s are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program \" generated \" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon \\'s , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 1800 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 10 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber \\'s email addresses from top to bottom . we cleaned these , and came up with about 100 , 000 addresses . these are also mixed in . we also included a 6 + million \" remove / flamer \" file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . \" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . your choice . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what others are saying : \" i received the cd on friday evening . like a kid with a new toy , i immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses . over the course of the weekend , i emailed out over 500 , 000 emails and i received less than twenty undeliverables ! ! i am totally satisfied with my purchase ! ! thanks premier ! ! \" dave buckley houston , tx \" this list is worth it \\'s weight in gold ! ! i sent out 100 , 000 emails for my product and received over 55 orders ! ann colby new orleans , la * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * here \\' s the bottom line here is what you get when you order today ! > > 10 million email addresses . . . 1 per line in simple text format on a cd . files are in lots of 5 , 000 ( no codes needed to open files ) . all files are separated by domain name for your convenience . plus you receive a tremendous remove list ! 6 million + > > > now only $ 150 . 00 ! this price is effective for the next seven days , thereafter the price will be $ 199 . 00 so order now ! all lists are completely free of any duplicates . we also on a continual basis , add new names and remove undeliverables and remove requests . the result is the cleanest email addresses available anywhere to use over and over again , for a fraction of the cost that other companies charge . typical rates for acquiring email lists are from 1 cent to as high as 3 cents per email address - that \\'s \" information highway \" robbery ! . * * * added bonus * * * all our customers will have access to our updates on the cd volume they purchase . that \\'s right , we continually work on our cd . who knows when those other cds were made . we \\' re constantly adding and deleting addresses , removes . etc . it all comes back to quality . no one else offers that ! do n\\'t even hesitate on this one or you will miss out on the most effective way to market anywhere . . . period ! if you have any further questions or to place an order by phone , please do not hesitate to call us at : 800-600 - 0343 ext . 2693 to order our email package , simply print out the ez order form below and fax or mail it to our office today . we accept visa , mastercard , amex , checks by fax . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ez order form _ _ _ _ _ yes ! i would like to order millions vol . 1a email addresses for only $ 150 . 00 . * please select one of the following for shipping . . _ _ _ _ i would like to receive my package overnight . i \\' m including $ 15 for shipping .

( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to \" show \" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ? on the bottom of this page , write your name , address and product , as you want it to appear on this mailer . please print clearly . make 3 copies of the following information that includes 1 ) other participants , 2 ) your name , address and product and 3 ) the control number . wrap a $ 10 check , money order or cash inside of each copy and send one to each of the following people with a self-addressed , stamped envelope . keep the original for your tax records ; it is a legitimate business expense . do not cheat by sending out only one payment . only 1 of the 3 has the required information you will need to proceed . within days , you will receive your products , instructions and this mailer with your name listed as one of the three participants . you will then send out 20 of these mailers to others . within a week , you will begin to receive your money , and within 4 weeks you will have earned over $ 25 , 000 ! it s that easy ! join today ! 1 . j . dolbow 2089 waterbury se kentwood , mi 49508 ( sweetish no - names ) 2 . l . shock 7438 sawmill rd . # 458 columbus , oh 43235 ( amy s famous chicken ) 3 . s . butler po box 770074 coral springs , fl 33077-0074 ( delicious potato salad ) your name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city , state , zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your product _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ control number 187329 * your total cost for this program is $ 40 . 00 ( $ 30 . 00 to members , $ 3 printing , $ 7 stamps ) . there are no other fees . * canadian residents ask that you please remember to use 2 first class stamps when mailing to them . believe me , the extra stamps are worth it . they are some of our best participants ! * if paying by check , please allow 7 additional days to allow the check to clear . important information to ensure that you keep this legal and honest , be sure to file schedule c profit or loss from business with your income tax return . report all income you receive and deduct all business related expenses . these tax deductible business expenses can include vehicle ownership ( in your company s name ) , expenses , travel and entertainment , business equipment , purchases for your business , supplies , telephone , postage , advertising costs , rent , wages ( other than your own ) , legal and professional services , and business taxes . these can be legally deducted if they are related to your business .

this is really a two fold question . let \\'s talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a \" no brainer \" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n\\'t - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here \\'s a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you \\' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i \\' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n\\'t think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed ! you will receive a phone number in report # 5599 where you can either reach me or someone from the parent company for any question or help you need ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ here \\'s a valuable bonus for ordering within 5 days . . . . your \\'s absolutely free !

( normally this kind of software is several hundred dollars ) they even give you easy to understand , proven , step by step instructions for success with this program . in fact , they helped me get started and i \\' m so thankful . it \\'s hard to believe that this as simple as it is , but it really is simple . you will even get support from them via email anytime you need it . you won\\'t get this kind of help from other programs of this nature . it makes all the difference in the world . my name is anne bowman . i am 31 - year-old graduate student desperately trying to finish my degree and begin working in my chosen field that is , if i am lucky enough to find a job in the crowded market . like most people in this day and age , it is hard to make ends meet , and being a student does not help the situation at all ( if i ever have to buy one more box of macaroni and cheese i think i would have to scream ) . i returned to school after having worked for several years with little potential for achieving what i had expected out of life . i figured if i returned to school and received my ph . d there would be several opportunities for me out there to achieve my goals . after seeing my fellow graduate students receive their degrees and , depressingly , not find respectable positions in their chosen field i began to think , \" oh no not again ! \" four extra years in school and an extra $ 20 , 000 in student loans on top of the first $ 18 , 000 , what will i do if the same happens to me ? \" i began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in schooling , and decided enough was enough , \" why can\\'t i make real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee of a lucrative return for all of my efforts ! \" i am writing to share my experience with other hopeful students out there , as well as anyone looking for an opportunity to take their financial situation into their own hands . i hope you will consider this opportunity seriously and that this will change your life forever ! . , financially ! ! ! and once you get started it takes so little of your time . in mid october 97 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . i took this as a sign ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , it made perfect sense . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start ( about as much as it costs for a pizza ! ) , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" i have nothing to lose \" . initially i sent 15 , 000 emails , ( without any costs to me ) only a couple of hours of my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the time to fulfil my orders . there is a vast on-line market available to everyone who owns a computer . following the advice of the person from whom i received this letter , i am telling you like it is , and i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! after you receive the reports they should explain everything to you . you may have some general questions , however , and after i send you report # 1 , please feel free to contact me and i will give you any advice you need . in one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by mid november , i had received 40 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that \" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks if you don \\' t send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by the beginning of december , i had received 174 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee . \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" . well , i had 174 orders for report # 2 , 74 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by january 20th , of my emailing of 15 , 000 , i received $ 54 , 000 with more coming in ever day . the great thing about this program is you can begin the process over and over again without any limit on potential income ! i paid off all my student loans , and together with everything i have learned in school , i am now saving in order to open up my own business related to my field as soon as i graduate . please take time to read the attached program . it will change your life forever ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place on the list . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders of report # 1 and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i \\' m sorry , it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . to my fellow graduate students out there , good luck to you and i sympathise . and to all other persons in financial trouble consider this letter a sign and please take advantage of this opportunity . you won \\' t be disappointed ! sincerely , anne bowman the following testimonial was at the bottom of this letter but it was too good to leave down there so i moved it up here . it is exactly how i felt at first and feel now . \" the first week after i started this program was torture . i could n\\'t wait to see if it was really going to work after i mailed out my first batch of letters . i chuckle every day now when i walk out of the post office with my envelopes . this is so easy , i still can\\'t believe it \\'s happening !

( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 down line members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . . . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - > $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 \\'s of participants ! think about it ! your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 for a chance to make $ 55 , 000 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists . some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade ! about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : i can \\' t stress enough how important this next section is ! ! ! ! if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! note : if you need help with starting a business , registering a business name , how income tax is handled , etc . , contact your local office of the small business administration ( a federal agency ) for free help and answers to questions . also , the internal revenue service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * the first week after i started this program was torture . i could n\\'t wait to see if it was really going to work after i mailed out my first batch of letters . i chuckle every day now when i walk out of the post office with my envelopes . this is so easy , i still can\\'t believe it \\'s happening ! don masterson , troy , ny this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md i just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . i even checked with the u . s . post office to verify that the plan was legal . it definitely is ! it works ! ! ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n\\'t delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

. . . . . . . . . . to make a long story short , because of this program , this year , will be going to austrailia , california , florida and missouri for a mouth a piece to play the tennis ciruit . i figure this will all cost me about $ 10-12000 which is easily affordable for me now . because i took a $ 20 \" risk \" , i now have a chance to pursue my dreams . i \\' m happy as a clam . i received this program via e-mail . all of the programs i had received in the past , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were ethier too diffcult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked out or not . even though i was still skeptical , thinging this to be one of the many scam multi-level \" opportunities \" , i figured $ 20 won\\'t break me and i can throwthis little amount away for that slim chance of making lots of money . but , wait a second . i believe i am an intelligent person and if someone like myself would go for this \" scam \" , i think many people would think the same way i do . even if it did \\' t work out , i figured that i would at least get my money back . but like i was saying , in september of 1997 , i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off of a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . after detrerminging that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" initially i sent 10 , 000 e-mails . the great thing about e-mail is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program . i am telling you like it is . i hope it does n\\'t turn you off but i promised myself i would not rip anyone off . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by october 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarntee in the program you will see that \" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , if you don \\' t send outmore programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20to 90 days was done . by november 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee . \" you must receive 100 ormore orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" . well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i need . so i sat back and relax . by january19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 people , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in everyday . please take time to read the attached program . it will change your life forever ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it excatly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders of report # 1 and 100 or more orders of report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or morein 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works !

this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mail and start the whole process again !

my name is karen liddell ; i \\' m a 35 - year-old mom , wife , and part-time accountant . as a rule , i delete all unsolicited \" junk \" e-mail and use my account primarily for business . i received what i assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time . about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , \" ok , i give in , i \\' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there \\'s nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . \" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i \\' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we \\' re going to venice , italy to celebrate !

simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the \" internet \" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your \\'s , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately !

now submitting to 250 + search engines , free . we are proud to announce that we now have two powerful versions of the web promote spider , our standard version and our brand new pro version . our standard version is designed for those individuals who have one or two sites that they want to be able to submit , and want to see dramatic increases in their sites visibility . our pro version is designed for isp 's , webmasters , hosting providers , and anyone who has multiple sites they need to promote thoroughly . while the standard version does track all registration campaigns for you , it can still be somewhat time intensive if you register several sites at once , or on a regular basis . you can see why the web promote spider is taking the net by storm ! professional version while the standard version of this product seems to meet the promotional needs of most of our customers , we also recognize the need for an ' industrial strength ' version of web promote spider . the professional version is designed for isp 's , webmasters , hosting providers , and anyone who has multiple sites they need to promote thoroughly . while the standard version tracks all registration campaigns for you , it can still be time intensive if you have to register several sites at once . to make this easier and more efficient for our customers , we have added several new features to the brand new professional version : deep promotion - this feature will automatically explore every internal link in your site , and develop registration information for each page for you automatically . for instance , in the standard version , if you have a 30 page site , you would have to run web promote spider thirty times , manually inputting each page into the registration queue . in the professional version , this is all automatic , and can be done in a matter of minutes . batch processing - if you are responsible for registering or maintaining several sites , you will find this feature particularly useful . you can load in multiple sites , and set the program to run all the sites at once , generating and saving a separate registration report on each . this report can easily be copied to the windows clipboard for pasting into reports , email , etc . expanded promotion resources - while the standard version of the spider will submit to 250 registration resources this list will continue to grow but not as quickly as what 's being planned on the professional version . the pro version currently has 400 and will soon have at least 1 , 000 automatic registration options / resources . if you ' re a previous owner of the standard version , the cost is only $ 49 . 95 to upgrade !

about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , \" ok , i give in , i \\' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there \\'s nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . \" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i \\' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we \\' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you \\' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you \\' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you !

simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the \" internet \" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your \\'s , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it \\'s own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that \\'s what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won\\'t get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say \" no \" than \" yes \" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it \\'s simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !',\n",

we at the world currency cartel would like to see a uniform global currency backed by gold . but , until then , we will allow a limited number of individuals worldwide to share in the unlimited profits provided for by the world currency differentials . we will espouse no more political views nor will we ask you to do so . we can say however , that our parent organization , ndml , benefits greatly by the knowledge being shared , as we ourselves , along with you , benefit likewise . your main concern surely will be , how you will benefit . as soon as you become a member , you will make transactions from your home , office , by telephone or through the mail . you can conduct these transactions even while traveling . do n\\'t believe us ? experience it for yourself !

it seems that most people that are selling cd \\'s are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program \" generated \" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon \\'s , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 1800 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 10 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber \\'s email addresses from top to bottom . we cleaned these , and came up with about 100 , 000 addresses . these are also mixed in . we also included a 6 + million \" remove / flamer \" file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . \" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . your choice . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what others are saying : \" i received the cd on friday evening . like a kid with a new toy , i immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses . over the course of the weekend , i emailed out over 500 , 000 emails and i received less than twenty undeliverables ! ! i am totally satisfied with my purchase ! ! thanks premier ! ! \" dave buckley houston , tx \" this list is worth it \\'s weight in gold ! ! i sent out 100 , 000 emails for my product and received over 55 orders ! ann colby new orleans , la * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * here \\' s the bottom line here is what you get when you order today ! > > 10 million email addresses . . . 1 per line in simple text format on a cd . files are in lots of 5 , 000 ( no codes needed to open files ) . all files are separated by domain name for your convenience . plus you receive a tremendous remove list ! 6 million + > > > now only $ 150 . 00 ! this price is effective for the next seven days , thereafter the price will be $ 199 . 00 so order now ! all lists are completely free of any duplicates . we also on a continual basis , add new names and remove undeliverables and remove requests . the result is the cleanest email addresses available anywhere to use over and over again , for a fraction of the cost that other companies charge . typical rates for acquiring email lists are from 1 cent to as high as 3 cents per email address - that \\'s \" information highway \" robbery ! . * * * added bonus * * * all our customers will have access to our updates on the cd volume they purchase . that \\'s right , we continually work on our cd . who knows when those other cds were made . we \\' re constantly adding and deleting addresses , removes . etc . it all comes back to quality . no one else offers that ! do n\\'t even hesitate on this one or you will miss out on the most effective way to market anywhere . . . period ! if you have any further questions or to place an order by phone , please do not hesitate to call us at : 800-600 - 0343 ext . 2693 to order our email package , simply print out the ez order form below and fax or mail it to our office today . we accept visa , mastercard , amex , checks by fax . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ez order form _ _ _ _ _ yes ! i would like to order millions vol . 1a email addresses for only $ 150 . 00 . * please select one of the following for shipping . . _ _ _ _ i would like to receive my package overnight . i \\' m including $ 15 for shipping .

\" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to \" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to \" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here \\' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can\\'t sell them if you do n\\'t order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 \\'s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps \" a \" through \" f \" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you \\' ll also see how it does n\\'t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you \\' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e - mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet advertising on the \\' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let \\'s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) assuming that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . ist level - - your 10 members with $ 5 - - $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 \\'s of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must dc , is e-mail them the report they ordered . that \\' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can\\'t advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number and name - 1 - - * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 \" the insider \\'s guide to advertising for free on the internet \" order report # 1 from : crossroads enterprises 5507-10 nesconset hwy . # 317 mt . siani , ny . 11766 report # 2 \" the insider \\'s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet \" order report # 2 from : laura waite rfd1 box 798 campton , nh . 03223 report # 3 \" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet \" order report 43 from : philip webster 1011 second st . port orange , fl . 32119 report # 4 \" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet \" order report # 4 from : patricia arnold 174 windward ct . s . port jefferson , ny . 11777 about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * * * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! above all , have faith in yourself and know you wilt , succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e - mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ? if the answer is yes , please look at the following facts about this program : 1 . you are selling a product which does not cost anything to produce , ship or advertise . 2 . all of your customers pay you in cash ! 3 . e - mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing information on earth . this program combines the distribution power of e-mail together with the revenue generating power of multi-level marketing . 4 . your only expenses other than your initial $ 20 investment is your time ! 5 . virtually all of the income you generate from this program is pure profit ! 6 . this program will change your life forever . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 19 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for a while , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi . i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n\\'t delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa i am nearing the $ 90 , 000 mark from this program . i have used several forms of advertisement . i used regular mail and bulk email . the regular mail was very expensive for 2 reasons . i purchased a very select list names , and the postage . the 3rd time i sent out e - mails , in the quantity of 700 , 000 . so , after 3 times participating in this program , i am almost at the $ 90 , 000 mark . that is n\\'t too bad . i hope the same success for you . good luck . . . . raymond mccormick , new cannan , ct . you have great potential for extra earnings that is available at your finger-tips ! you have unlimited access to wealth , but you must be willing to take that first step ! the media already proved that ! ! ! ! ! ! you could be making an obscene amount of money ! i have given you the information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now ! - think about it - your risk is only $ 20 . ?

hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n\\'t believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i \\' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , \" please put me on your mailing list \" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i \\' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that \\'s with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it \\'s more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you \\' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won\\'t be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !',\n",

it seems that most people that are selling cd \\'s are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program \" generated \" email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon \\'s , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 150 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining = list , it reduced it down to near 16 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber \\'s email addresses from top to bottom . we did not clean these , but we did = create 3 seperate files named cyber1 . txt , cyber2 . txt , & cyber3 . txt of 100 , 000 addresses each . this will give all people that use the list a = opportunity to send mail to the list before deciding if their cd is all it \\'s hyped to = be . we also included a 2 + million \" remove / flamer \" file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of = removes . \" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . your choice . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what others are saying : = 20 \" i received the cd on friday evening . like a kid with a new toy , i immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses . over the course of the weekend , i emailed out over 500 , 000 emails and i received less than twenty undeliverables ! ! i am totally satisfied with my purchase ! ! thanks premier ! ! \" dave buckley houston , tx \" this list is worth it \\'s weight in gold ! ! i sent out 100 , 000 emails for = my product and received over 55 orders ! ann colby new orleans , la * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * = 20 here \\' s the bottom line here is what you get when you order today ! > > 16 million email addresses . . . 1 per line in simple text format on a = cd . files are in lots of 100 , 000 ( no codes needed to open files ) . all files are separated by domain name for your convenience . = 20 plus you receive a tremendous remove list ! = 20 and = 20 the a sampling of cyberpromo \\'s hot list . > > > now only $ 149 . 00 ! this price is effective for the next seven days , thereafter the price = will be $ 199 . 00 so order now ! all lists are completely free of any duplicates . we also on a continual basis , add new names and remove undeliverables and remove requests . = 20 the result is the cleanest email addresses available anywhere to use over and over again , for a fraction of the cost that other companies charge . typical rates for acquiring email lists are from 1 cent to as high as 3 cents per email address - that \\'s \" information highway \" robbery ! . do n\\'t even hesitate on this one or you will miss out on the most effective way to market anywhere . . period ! if you have any further questions or to place an order by phone , please do not hesitate to call us at : 908-245 - 1143 to order our email package , simply print out the ez order form below and fax or mail it to our office today . = 20 we accept visa , mastercard , amex , checks by fax and mail . = 20 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ez order form = 20 = 20 _ _ _ _ _ yes ! i would like to order millions vol . 1 email addresses for only $ 149 . 00 . = 20 = 20 * please select one of the following for shipping . . = 20 _ _ _ _ i would like to receive my package overnight . i \\' m including $ 15 for shipping .

( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . . . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - > $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 \\'s of participants ! think about it ! your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only = 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . . . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - > $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they = got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 \\'s of participants ! think = about it ! your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and = e-mail is free ! report # 3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists . some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade ! about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you = should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it = won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that = it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , = with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good = money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk = mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population = and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless = fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the = thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me !

simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but over the summer donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating , trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response \" that \\'s why i \\' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to \" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to \" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here \\' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can\\'t sell them if you do n\\'t order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 \\'s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps \" a \" through \" f \" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you \\' ll also see how it does n\\'t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you \\' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 4 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . in addition you will be provided with information on internet marketing clubs such as internet marketing resources ( imr ) : this is one the premiere internet marketing clubs on the internet . this club provides a forum where internet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on internet marketing . in addition , this club specializes in providing free internet marketing tools and services for the do - yourself - internet - marketer . they will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1 , 000 , 000 fresh e-mail addresses each week . this club will provide you with hundreds of free resources which include : how to obtain free web sites , how to obtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site , how to send bulk e-mail into aol and compuserve , how to market your products on newsgroups , free classified ads , electronic malls , bulletin boards , banner ads and much more . imr \\' s web address is : http : / / www . ixpres . com / imrs / marketing1 . htm ( not working . . . check the links below ) http : / / www . onlinemlm . com / http : / / www . promlm . com / resources / index . shtml there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the \\' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let \\'s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 - - - - - - - - - - - this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate !

* * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again !

especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . steven bardfield , portland , or my name is mitchell . my wife , jody , and i live in chicago , il . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to jody about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined jody in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . mitchell wolf md . , chicago , il the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , charles morris , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . paige willis , des moines , ia i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program , . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n\\'t delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! violet wilson , johnstown , pa this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

what a great device ! &quot ; dr . frank pisano , clearwater , fl &quot ; my television sound regulator works beautiful ! prompt service = 96 = great pr . your company stands behind its product . &quot ; carl lattimer , passaic , nj &quot ; i first read about the tvsr in technology update . being a prod = uct design engineer , at first i doubted that the information presented in = the article was technically accurate . being originally form missouri , t = he show me state , i had to see for myself . i ordered one . it was easy t = o connect . believe me , you don = 92t have to have a ph . d . in engineering t = o install it ! i do a lot of channel surfing so i was the perfect person = to test it . well , i was very , very surprised at the results . when you s = ay that the &quot ; tvsr instantly increases or decreases the sound output = to a preset level&quot ; , you are not kidding . even with sophisticated ti = ming equipment , the interval with which the sound level is adjusted is so = short that the human ear can = 92t even register it ! i still can = 92t defi = ne how the tvsr functions . but who cares , as long as it works ! the negative thing about the tvsr is that i didn = 92t invent it ! &quot ; = kathy kurtis , pasadena , ca &quot ; i just had to write to you about our newest second favorite arr = ival . our first is our brand new son , kevin . he is going to be six week = s old soon . our second newest favorite is the tv sound regulator . you s = ee , kevin , like all newborns is very sensitive to noise , especially at ni = ght when it = 92s so quiet you can hear a pin drop . before we got the tv s = ound regulator i couldn = 92t watch television while i nursed him . he woul = d just have fallen asleep when one of those loud commercials would wake h = im up . then it would take forever before he fell asleep again , i would b = e sitting there rocking him to sleep . although i love my son , i was left = with nothing to do . but now , with the tv sound regulator , i can turn th = e volume so it is soft enough to lull him to sleep , and i can catch up on = watching my favorite programs too ! the vcr even records the programs wi = thout that awful volume jump each time a commercial plays ! &quot ; &quot ; ps& # 9 ; i also wanted to thank your technical support department , = when i had a question about connecting it , they were so nice and friendl = y . they walked me through the entire installation process in only a few = minutes . \" &quot ; lisa russo , monroe , ct &quot ; i thought i = 92d write you this short letter to let you know jus = t how pleased we are with the automatic tv sound regulator . my husband a = nd i have a three-year - old boy . believe me he is extremely active and en = ergetic . in the evening , after we have put our son to sleep , we now can = truly relax in front of our tv . in the past , before we purchased your pr = oduct , it used to be extremely annoying watching television . the commerc = ials would come on so loud that we could hardly hear ourselves think . we = would always have to turn the television down during the commercials and = up again when our show came on . your product really works ! &quot ; robert pelikan , phoenix , az &quot ; excellent product ! i customarily do not take the time to write = a letter such as this . it took me less than ten minutes to install the = tv sound regulator ( i have a tv , vcr , and satellite dish ) . this thing ac = tually works ! amazing ! also , thank you for replacing the damaged unit s = o quickly . your customer service is great ! harold j . c . ferrer , ph . d . , glendale , ca &quot ; i am a very busy psychologist . my days , often twelve-hour days = , are spent listening to emotion filled voices . because of the specializ = ed work i do , the majority of my patients are emotionally and psychologic = ally overwhelmed . their lives are out of control . they often have lost = their jobs , homes , and marriages . they are inundated by life shattering = stress . needless to say , by the end of my day , i need to relax . i need = peace and quiet . i usually channel surf for a while , until i settle in t = o watching cnn . but , until i bought a tvsr , i found myself scrambling fo = r the remote control each time a commercial was about to come on . when i = couldn = 92t reach it in time the increased commercial volume literally ma = de me jump . this is not the way to relax ! the worse stress , and stress = is always there , is the stress that we cannot control . but , with the tvs = r , i can just set the volume control to the level i want . i now know tha = t whenever an advertiser has decided that sh ! ! ! ! ! outing is the only way to get my attention , i can rest assured that i will literally have the upper hand . = i no longer feel that i am at the mercy of those blaring commercials . = at least i can now control my television !

in short , any theme which has relevance to the study and teaching of language and literature and their role in society . the 1992 conference theme to highlight the currently expanding field of discours studies , the 1992 conference has as its core theme \\' literature and the analysis of discourse , with special attention to the multicultural context \\' . papers covering interests as wide as the processes of writing and reading literature , the analysis of dialogic text , oral literary traditions , the relationship between literary and non-literary discourse , discourse theory and literary communication as social practice have all been proposed , as well as those dealing specifically with the writing and reading of literature in a multilingual and / or multicultural context . the 1992 conference venue gent university is of the city type ; there is no campus , and university buildings are dotted around the town . conference sessions will take place in the hoveniersberg , overlooking the bovenschelde in one of the quiet parts of town . programme conference sessions will start on the morning of the wednesday and last a full three days . it is envisaged that most participants will arrive and register on the tuesday evening . our provisional programme looks like this : tuedsday 8 sept 15 . 00 onwards : registration wednesday 9 sept 08 . 30 - 09 . 30 : late registration 09 . 45 : opening of conference 10 . 00 - 18 . 00 : conference sessions 18 . 30 : pre-booked dinner 20 . 15 : drinks reception thursday 10 sept 08 . 30 - 18 . 00 : conference sessions 18 . 30 : pala agm 20 . 00 : pre-booked dinner friday 11 sept 08 . 30 - 17 . 00 : conference sessions 17 . 15 : wind-up session evening : activities to be arranged there will be continuous coffee , tea , etc . throughout the conference sessions . accommodation rooms in the vermeylen student hall of residence , a couple of hundred metres from the conference centre , are available to all participants . it is possible to book rooms for several nights either side of the conference dates . the price on the registration form includes breakfast . unfortunately , no double rooms are available . if you would prefer to stay in a hotel , we recommend the arcade hotel ( nederkouter , 9000 gent ;

( 1b ) above ] . lrules ( or norms-of - language qua institutional or cultural facts ) are typically learned or acquired by experience . but some norms are so deeply rooted in human nature that their violation is more or less unnatural and requires an extra effort . ( this is one of the basic tenets of stampean natural phonology , unless i \\' m mistaken . ) for example , anyone standing on two hands ( instead of two legs ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the \\' two-leg \\' constraint is almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) is an exemplification , is almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by producing ( 2b ) . but it is a norm , nonetheless . > and what merit is there to making such a distinction > at all ? this distinction is ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarians \\' actual practice . martti nyman , dept of general linguistics , univ of helsinki , finland',\n",

[ on the same theme , i have a paper coming out ( perhaps it has come out already ) in the journal of linguistics on the genealogical connections between prosodic ( firthian ) phonology and autosegemmental phonology . ] dan has also pointed out that some of the major contributors to phonology during this period who are still very much alive and intellectual active have felt slighted by the lack of citation of their work . as i tried to suggest in my paper on firthian phonology , this is more an indictment of normal human expectations of courtesy than it is the result of people actually forgetting about these phonologists ' good , published ideas ( there is much less of that latter sin than many people wish to believe - - a point that geoff huck and i have made in a recent paper on the relation of generative semantics to current syntactic theory ) . however - - and again from a purely human point of view - - i wonder how many people , like myself , who were publishing material on nonlinear phonology in , say , its first ten years ( 1975 to 1985 ) ever received a note from one of these contributers to the literature in the 1940s and 1950s ? speaking just for myself , i am sure i would have been galvanized to have been dropped a note by . . . any of a number of linguists ; in more recent years , i ' ve had the opportunity to discuss the history of the field , in writing and in person , with a number of these linguists . but i would have been absolutely delighted to have received such a comment , a bit of mild reproof perhaps from an established contributor ( who , now , i can perceive as feeling left out ) . i never did . anyone else ? john goldsmith\",\n",

( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor \\'s much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against .

bar notation for immediate constituent analysis , though of course not by that name , to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the head-of relation . he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis . he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology , by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes , a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once . he invented string analysis as a complement ( not rival ) to immediate constituent analysis . their complementarity with respect to the head-of problem is the basis of joshi \\'s tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts . other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today , and in other fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based on word dependency , discourse analysis for information content , and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics . for example , string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts , applied there mainly to medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts , based on operator grammar . successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics . it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him . he knew that his work was of lasting importance , and treated it as such , but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers , and would not accept any such role being projected onto him . those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed . however , he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment . he did not provide such entree , nor did he pretend to , and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field . once , in my role as ta for john fought , i prepared a lecture on harris \\'s approach to syntax and semantics . as we were setting out for the lecture hall , we encountered harris , and i blurted out \" i \\' m about to give a lecture on your theory to john \\'s class . \" ( john , with characteristic wry humor , asked if he wanted to take anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing . nonetheless , when he gave a public lecture on \" the two structures of language : report and paraphrase \" in 1969 or 1970 , the large auditorium ( i think it was in the furness building ) was filled to capacity , and the critique by john corcoran , published later in the volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited by senta ploetz , was also well attended . broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his , had he chosen it . that is simply not where his ambitions lay . a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position , many years ago . do n\\'t invite anybody over for dinner , he said , and do n\\'t accept any invitations . if you get involved in the social life of an academic , you won\\'t be able to get any work done . the work came first . harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family . the consequences , when combined with his laissez-faire anarchism , were not always happy . his friend and close colleague of many years , henry hiz , was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution . the disparity of character could be devastating to students . i studied with harris from 1966 through 1970 . i was an undergraduate much of that time , but that did not matter to him . he had a sink-or - swim approach like that attributed to sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of , say , athabaskan . he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on . when i started with him , this was the work that resulted in his 1968 book , _ mathematical structures of language _ ( wiley ) . the process was not a lecture or monologue , but a continuing conversation with his students , trying out alternatives , posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language . after a while , with intensive reading outside , one began to catch on and to participate . i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory . this troubled him not a bit . i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach . ( i had lived in greece for a couple of years , and spoke the language , but i worked with an informant for this project . ) when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge , he merely thanked me for the data on greek . a year or two later , i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis , much as martha evens and now others have done . although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work , he said ( and this is an exact quote ) \" others have tried this and have failed , but you are welcome to try . \" i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial . i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz , never with harris . i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work . i think it did not matter to him . he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics . maybe his attitude differed in the 1940s , when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as _ methods in structural linguistics _ . ( btw , the title was to have said \" descriptive \" but the publisher substituted the buzzword \" structural . \" i recall him saying , amusedly , \" i do n\\'t remember whether they asked me or not . \" ) maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky \\'s followers began making him out to be the bad guy . i do n\\'t think so , based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then . i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the \" transformational revolution . \" there is a passage in _ the state of the art _ ( 1968 ) in which hockett attributes to harris \" nothing , or a long silence , after 1957 , \" showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis , for which he might be excused , but even ignoring the 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published in _ language _ . i showed this passage to harris , and he shrugged . it did not matter . in particular , i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky \\'s ambitions . in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him . for example , it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the 1962 international congress . a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language . one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero . now , an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back , so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris . he accomplished what he intended to quite well , thank you very much , and seems to have been quite happy in the process . the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work . and uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley \\'s review of _ a grammar of english on mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is a good example . he identifies harris \\'s operator grammar with predicate calculus , though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language ( a fortiori operator grammar ) and language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do 1960s generative grammar in 1980 , because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris \\'s work on its own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 in _ computers in the humanities _ ) asserted that harris \\'s grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , the semantics of find vs . seek , and quantifier scope in examples like \" someone was opposed by everyone . \" in my review ( _ computational linguistics _ in 1984 ) i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book . michael kac , in his review of harris \\'s selected writings , asked \" why bother ? \" and indeed , from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question . it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see , having these writings in one place , how consistent and self coherent harris \\'s program has been over the years . transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution . i will mention only one other misconception about harris \\'s work , not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace . i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim . ( jim mccawley \\'s witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke . ) it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief . discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined . when _ methods _ was published , linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions . now , discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy . this has colored perceptions of harris \\'s intentions and results . for harris , it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next , but this was a corroborative byproduct , not an aim . the \" constructional procedure \" described in the 1955 paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early 1960s and proven to work , and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts . but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible . in particular , he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants , one had to control the language oneself . and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form , a lengthy and demanding process , as probably most of us know from experience . so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus , turning a crank , and having a grammar reel out the other end . in the introduction to _ methods in structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures . he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules of thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language , and so on , more art than science ( or rather , more art than engineering ) . harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one \\'s control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples . language is after all a social institution , continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use . the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses , but to verify , for any given result , whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language . of those who have actually read the book , how many have said ( and some have in fact said to me ) \" he did n\\'t really mean that . \" but if nothing else , harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant . this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris \\'s later work . this is a critical point for linguistics . for any other science , there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience . in particular , practitioners in physics , chemistry , even in mathematics , rely on the \" background vernacular \" of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions , however reached , to the observations on which they are based . not so for a science of language . harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . and , observably , each language contains its own metalanguage . i \\' ll repeat that , because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about , and because it is easy to overlook its importance . there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . by contrast , generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage , external to language , that is part of one \\'s biological endowment . ( i personally do not find this biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible , but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined . ) this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in \" why phonology is n\\'t natural . \" one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics . harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information , and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than 50 years . intuitively , we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning , but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language ( say , in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples ) . what harris found was how this messy , inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems : a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a subject-matter domain such as a science subfield , and a system of reductions that changes word shapes ( often to zero ) , motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention . the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase , and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning , but without destroying that correlation . given that structure ( differences of form ) correlates with meaning , it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language . harris \\'s endeavor was always , then , to determine a \" least grammar , \" a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations . any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language . this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language . harris chose not to make such a critique . when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory , he would only comment , with evidence of mild amusement , that it did seem to be over-structured . like his teacher , sapir , harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language . ( a paper on this appeared in a 1962 volume on avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science . this culminated in _ the form of information in science : analysis of an immunology sublanguage _ ( with michael gottfried , tom ryckman , and others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field , based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage . the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists \\' perceptions in the domain of their science . a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning . the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape , some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy , some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution . harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work . i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one , to which members give their assets and income , and which in turn supports them in their needs . i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street . until his retirement , he held an endowed chair at penn , the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics . he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf , nimh , and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value . throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science . his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem , and had been albert einstein \\'s assistant at princeton . a brother was an immunologist ( he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the 1989 book ) . he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science , and would not participate in it . that too would be a distraction from the work . after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in 1986 , a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him . he mentioned poetry , especially the longer works of 19th century poets like browning . he mentioned music . and he mentioned sign language . he had a long and very productive life . he had brought his life \\'s work to a successful culmination . with the completion of his book on politics , i imagine death coming to him , as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal , and him saying \" ok , i \\' m ready now . \" it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him . he is an abiding inspiration . bruce nevin bn @ bbn . com',\n",

\" he queried . responses to raskin \\'s question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called \" linguistnet \" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee \\'s curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee \\'s attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition \\'s organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee \\'s decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into \" linguistnet \" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . \" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher \" , she said wednesday . \" young children , almost universally , pick up their accents from their peers . \" she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country , they would find that the children have not adopted their parents \\' accent . many others agreed . \" i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played the organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest , \" craig thiersch , a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said . \" but all their children had strong \\' towny \\' accents . \" \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n\\'t influenced by the foreign accents of their parents , much less their teachers , \" echoed university of georgia professor michael a . covington . \" kids get their accents from their peers , \" agreed susan ervin - tripp from the university of california at berkeley . while the linguists roundly criticized the petition , some said they could understand why some parents signed it . noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors , they acknowledged that a teacher \\'s english should be understandable . but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor , they said . \" my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students , but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition , \" partee said . she said at umass , foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood . \" but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent . \" [ end of newpaper article . ] in the same paper , there was a nice column by william raspberry . much of it repeats things we \\' ve been over on the net ; i extract here a bit from the ending : \" as one who was taught french by a german - accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of \" consonants and wowels , \" i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard . but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard ? and who determines it ? how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers ? how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin ? where is the universal principle ? kant might not want to hear this , but the principle is the problem . a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat . she \\'d listen , make some experience-based judgment as to whether a teacher \\'s accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment . she might not even be able to tell you , in close cases , what tipped the judgment one way or another , but would that really be so awful ? only if you try to make it a kantian universal . make it a principle , and you \\' re stuck willy-nilly with language panels , ethnic spokespersons , teachers \\' union reps and , of course , lawyers . before it \\'s over , people will stop speaking to each other across racial or ethnic lines , and everybody will be working to get everybody else fired or defeated for re-election . the problem , of course , will remain unresolved . as they say in massachusetts ( or would if they thought of it ) , some things can be addressed in terms of the philosopher \\'s \" universal law . \" some kant .',\n",

( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph \" linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good \" model \" in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . \" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades \" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . \" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city \\'s school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state \\'s secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal \" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . \" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as \" bovine scatology . \" the state \\'s attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state \\'s anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i \\' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday \\'s nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , \" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . \" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there \\'s a great deal of debate about whether it \\'s racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? \" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : \" by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners \\' request . i \\' ll know more by this evening \\'s news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i \\' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . \" the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners \\' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners \\' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n\\'t even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . \" cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : \" of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher \\'s foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ?

) your conversations since now a good year , but , not being a linguist myself , i usually do not talk a lot . first , as a teacher of french language in taiwan , i must tell how much i feel listening to this list really brings me a lot . specially as i hold a non-prescriptive view of my own language ( contrary , i think , to the majority of teachers ( ? ) , and certainly to our embattled french ministre de la culture , mr toubon , that a lot of people in france now usually call mr . \" allgood \" : ) . i was prompted to write by the problem of the evolution of languages . . . so it is not so far from my allusion to mr . toubon with with i opened my message . . . it seems to me obvious that , ( apart from phonological evolution ) a language may evolve , at the morpho-systactic level , from acculturation , that is , influence of another , ( \" dominant \" or not ) language , in historical times , close geographically , but also through commercial contacts ( the modern times is another story - what does mean \" close \" when i can talk with you from taiwan ? ) . but i think the matter is quite more complicated that all that has been mentionned so far . . . first the chinese case seems to me very complicated and specific : a - there is a chinese \" isolat \" for about 4000 years ( quite no interaction with other cultures , except the bouddhist indian one , where it gave rise to a quite specific \" sub-language \" , mainly phonetic transcription of samskrit words into adapted-on - purpose chinese characters , but which has little to do with generic chinese , b - there is a feed-back from the ideographs , so that chinese language does n\\'t evolve independantly from its writing since a long time , c - because the phonologic evolution of the spoken language is not directly reflected onto the writing system , which builts upon its own logic , it is possible that its laws of evolution could be very different from languages using alphabetic or syllabic systems of notation ( ? ) . more : my french is certainly influenced by the english i use on internet , and the chinese i use in day-to - day life ( to the point that i sometimes realise that , while talking to my sister in france by phone , i find myself unthinkingly telling her : \" j \\' habite dans une petite hsiang derriere l \\' ecole . \" ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( i live in a little hsiang just behind the school - - \" hsiang \" being the chinese for a little alley connected to a main street ) . and having to apologize and reexplain . . . but i mainly switch between the languages , and there is little chance i create my own pidgin or creole . . . so do many taiwanese ( min-nan ) speaking people in the south of the island . . . so does it not mean that the evolution should depend on the education level of people - so that it would be differential inside a society according to , say , the social class ? there is probably as well a \" critical mass effect \" ( if france was turned into some chinese-dominant state . . . ) . is not our idea of \" homogeneity \" in evolution vitiated by the pretention of modern nation-states to generate a \" super-culture \" - through linguistic homogeneisation ? ) - i am also aware of phenomenons of resistance to acculturative evolution ( conscious or not ) as for the quebecquois telling , not \" un hot-dog \" as the french do , but \" un chien chaud \" ( toubon being in my opinion but a marginal impedement on the natural evolution , whatever direction it takes ) . . . - another exemple of the complexity of those issue would be the \" rigidification \" of a language facing a threat . it was given to me as an explanation when i was a student of kurdish , when i learnt that this language has in common with old persian an \" ergative \" ( ? ) construction for transitive verbs in past tenses , which was presented to me as a \" quite - passive \" construction . to allow for comparisons by more knowledgeable people , i will explain a little : there , the infix representing the agent is appended at the end of the verb , while the infix representing the subject is appended after the object , as : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xuward - 0 ( - eke and ek ( [ ^ e ] k ) being suffixes expressing definiteness ( eke = the ) ( child-the apple-one - he ate ) and indefiniteness respectively ( ek = a ) ) here , - y represents the child , - 0 a null infix ( there is only one apple ) , so \" the child ate the apples \" would be : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xiward-n < - - - - \" - n \" : there are several apples ( child-the apples-the - he ate-them ) so i was told at this time that this construct , which was used in old persian ( and is still used in the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan , is an archaic construction , characteristic of the periphery of the indo-iranian domain , that is , in kurdistan ( south-kurmandji , or sorani-speaking part ) , and also among the baluches , and represents a rigidification of the language due to a threat from other languages , ( so that languages at a domain periphery would sometimes evolve more slowly ) and that it has disappeared from standard modern persian . . . i would want to know if all that is still considered true , though . what do you think of it ? i guess there are as well different levels of evolution taking place simultaneously , that can be contradictory ( phonology , vocabulary , syntax . . . ) . anyway , i see several reasons why it should be difficult to infer any \" linear \" evolution of languages ( whatever fascination i feel when i read posts speaking of modelisations of 10 or 20 000 years back . . . ) on anything else that a case-by - case basis ( or does the fact that populations densities has obviously undergone a dramatic change since then , changing the dynamics of contacts . . . ? ? ? ? ) . to resume my questions : how can we ascertain that this language has had this reaction without having to resort to extra-linguistic implicit hypothesis as : homogeneity through classes , identity of evolution whatever the number of speakers would be ( lng-switching vs creolisation . . . ) , existence ( or not ) , type , and evolution of a scripting system ( * * ) etc . . . ? as i told , i am no linguist , ( neither \" linguistician \" nor philologist : ) , so i hope i did not waste your time , thus getting all your community angry at me ( ack ! - terrible perspective ) . but i will be very interested to read more about all this . friendly to all , gerard gautier ( * * ) once more , kurdish would be a good case in point , as it uses up to three different scripting systems according to the place ( latin , arabo-persian , cyrillic for the north-kurmandji , and latin and arabo-persian for sorani ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ wen-tzao school | \\\\ | / / gerard gautier of foreign languages | / \\\\ \\\\ | . . \\\\ | \\\\ | | _ _ > | _ / \\\\ _ > o _ _ _ > kaohsiung - taiwan _ / _ / . . _ / ( _ s . . _ / gauier @ cc . nsysu . edu . tw ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~',\n",

- in other words , as if there had been leftists ( in the us ) who applied the term to themselves without irony . now , what had been something of an inside leftwing joke has been turned into a weapon brandished against the left . for example , in 1982 , say , a leftist might have blown off steam about some dogmatic person or organization by characterizing her or it as \" politically correct . \" but now i hear the term used by non-leftists , often to evoke an image of rigid leftist / multi-culturalist / academic types taking over our institutions and seeking to control our minds -

( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .\",\n",

( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it \\'s different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it \\'s especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that \\'s because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i \\' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really \\'s now \\' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decided to count synonyms together , will you also count together both of the members of noun-verb pairs having basically the same meaning ? ( the members are , technically speaking , separate lexemes since partly idiosyncratic morphological changes mark the verbal forms , and must therefore be listed separately in any truly informative dictionary , as indeed jacobson \\'s dictionary does . ) ( d ) following jacobson , i \\' ve specially labelled those lexemes that only occur in a small subpart of the central alaskan yupik - speaking region . are you going to try to make counts for each separate dialect ? if yes , you will wonder if you really have enough information to do so .

[ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 \\'s when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i \\' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists \\' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it \\'s * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n\\'t there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where \\'s our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can\\'t stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic \\' attractors \\' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein \\'s relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a \" pseudo-science \" , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n\\'t need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : \" logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval \\'s most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be \\'s cientific \\' - - then it had to be \\' logical \\' \" . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , \" [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? \" [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a \\'s hamanic stance \\' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as \\' cause \\' and \\'d etermine \\' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( \" what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . \" ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word \\' karma \\' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the \\' comes around \\' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning \\'d irect object of verb \\' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < \" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round \" > < - - john lennon >',\n",

the bounded constructions . the present paper offers a theory of binding in ccg which preserves the original account of the unbounded dependencies , and which renders it immediately compatible with other theories , tag in particular . the theory requires the abandonment of one assumption that has been traditional ( though not essential ) in other categorial approaches . the significance of the move is discussed . ircs-94 -

( these remarks are independent of any assessment of johanna nichol \\'s book that fritz referred to , incidentally . ) first , good typological work devotes a substantial amount of effort to defining and delimiting what sorts of constructions should or should not belong to a particular structural type . good examples are many of dryer \\'s papers ( e . g . dryer 1989a , 1989b , 1992 ) , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 : ch . 1 - 3 on nominalizations , stassen 1985 : ch . 2 , 4 on comparative and \\' chaining \\' constructions , and haspelmath 1993 : ch . 2 on indefinite pronouns . more generally , the discussion of the proper typological markedness criteria in croft 1990 : ch . 4 - 6 is an attempt to provide some * general * structural criteria for a large class of cross-linguistic phenomena ( see for example the formulation of the structural consequences of hopper & thompson 1980 \\'s transitivity hypothesis on p . 131 , or the application of the criteria to the syntactic category problem in croft 1991 : ch . 2 - 3 ) . delimiting and classifying the phenomena to be analyzed is not a simple descriptive task ; in fact , it raises some of the most interesting issues in typological analysis , and have hardly been ignored in the typological literature . second , with respect to basicness for a language type in particular , in the passage from croft 1990 that fritz referred to ( pp . 33-36 ) , i argued that typologists had moved from classifying languages typologically to classifying constructions typologically , and that that was a good thing . nevertheless , i suggested some general criteria for determining a \" basic \" language type . and despite my reservations about identifying \" basic \" language types , it has to be said that in the great majority of cases , defining a \" language type \" instead of a \" construction type \" is not terribly difficult . matthew dryer ( p . c . ) has observed that inspection of texts generally tells you very quickly what the \" word order type \" of a language is . in my own experience , in a study where i am comparing the syntax of prenominal and postnominal modifiers , i am quite frustrated at how difficult it is to find languages where a modifier freely occurs both pre - and postnominally . of course , identification of \" basic \" or other types depends on what resources you have available to you ( quality of grammatical descriptions , availability of texts / language consultants etc . ) as well as what phenomenon you are studying ( e . g . word order or head marking [ easier ] vs . relative order of modifiers or the syntax of nonrestrictive modification [ harder ] ) . but for most studies it is not an insurmountable problem , although there always some problematic cases . third , the sampling problem * has * been discussed at some length by typologists ( besides bell 1978 \\'s seminal article , see also dryer 1989c , perkins 1989 , croft 1990 : 18-25 , rijkhoff et al . 1993 ) . the issues are too complex to go into here at length . but it should be pointed out that the issues fritz raises apply to different sorts of samples with different purposes in mind . the question of how independent particular instances are have to do with probability samples ( see in particular the dryer , perkins and croft references for discussion of these problems ) . note in particular that the stability of the phenomenon being studied is an important factor : the less stable it is , the more likely cases are historically independent . the question of coming across rare types pertains to variety samples ( see in particular rijkhoff et al . ) . some studies ( e . g . tomlin 1986 , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 , haspelmath 1993 ) draw on a very large variety sample and then select a stratified probability sample from it for the appropriate generalizations . dryer \\'s sampling technique attempts to combine the needs of variety and probability samples into a single sampling procedure . i should also add that with the shift towards dynamic ( diachronic ) interpretations of synchronic typological patterns , the examination of cognate phenomena in related languages , and the comparison of \" nonbasic \" as well as basic typological strategies , becomes another important method of analysis . that means that to some extent , the problems of basic vs . nonbasic types in a single language , and of historical relatedness of data sets , can be avoided - - - in fact , exploited - - - in modern typological analysis . bill croft references : bell , alan . 1978 . language samples . universals of human language , vol . 1 : method and theory , ed . joseph h . greenberg , charles a . ferguson and edith a . moravcsik , 123-156 . stanford : stanford university press . croft , william . 1990 . typology and universals . cambridge : cambridge university press . - . 1991 . syntactic categories and grammatical relations : the cognitive organization of information . chicago : university of chicago press . dryer , matthew . 1989a . plural words . linguistics 27 . 865-95 . - . 1989b . article - noun order . cls 25 . 84-97 . - . 1989c . large linguistic areas and language sampling . studies in language 13 . 257-92 . - . 1992 . the greenbergian word order correlations . language 68 : 81 - 138 . hopper , paul and sandra a . thompson . 1980 . transitivity in grammar and discourse . language 56 . 251-299 . koptjevskaja - tamm , maria . 1988 . a typology of action nominal constructions . stockholm : university of stockholm . perkins , revere d . 1989 . statistical techniques for determining language sample size . studies in languagea013 : 293-315 . rijkhoff , jan , dik bakker , kees hengveld & peter kahrel . a method of language sampling . studies in language 17 . 169-203 . stassen , leon . 1985 . comparison and universal grammar . oxford : basil blackwell . tomlin , russell . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . dept of linguistics , u manchester , oxford rd , manchester m13 9pl , uk w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk fax : + 44-61 - 275 3187 phone : 275 3188',\n",

working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of \" minimal refereeing \" by the ippe \\'s international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe \\'s large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same \" minimal refereeing \" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the

electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic communications resources , and especially to the submission of materials , and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic publishers in these fields . much was accomplished , and even greater possibilities lie ahead . renovations nearly complete the international philosophical preprint exchange \\'s ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the preprints and other documents on the ippe to be distributed simultaneously by means of the world wide web in addition to the previously implemented gopher , ftp , and mail-server access methods is nearly complete . the customized software we have developed for this purpose allows the ippe staff to easily make a single copy of a working paper available through all four of our supported access methods . accessing the international philosophical

( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) \" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as \" john asked mary to leave \" as meaning \" john asked mary \\'s permission to leave \" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that \" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we \\' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . \" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in \" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , \" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that \" we \\' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . \" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . he contends that these sentences \" are typically interpreted pragmatically taking into account perceived authority ; i . e . , in [ 1 ] the teacher tells the child to leave ; in [ 2 ] the child asks whether s / he can leave . \" in either case , it is likely that it is the child who will be leaving . i should note that this pair of examples proved to be particularly amusing and illuminating to my students - - especially to those who , like me , found the \\' permission \\' reading peculiar . tony \\'s examples demonstrated to them to what extent pragmatic knowledge plays a part in interpretation . the responses to the infinitive problem constituted only one of several lines pursued by my respondents . some , who like me teach undergraduate syntax courses , commented on the difficulty a few students have with even rudimentary syntactic analysis ( e . g . , the subject / predicate split , often claimed to be a universal strategy among english speakers ) . others commented on the familiar problem of intuition fatigue ( which could be summed up as \" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a good string 50 times and it sounds weird \" ) . and still others took issue with the entire enterprise of a separate syntax , particularly of the generative variety , though by now it should be clear that any decontextualized sentence has the potential to give rise to more than one intepretation . in fact this very idea is discussed in carson schutze \\'s forthcoming book , _ the empirical base of linguistics : grammaticality judgments and linguistic methodology _ , to be published by university of chicago press in 1995 . in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data \" can provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . \" finally , one last thread was contributed by larry hutchinson , who mentioned the history of introspection in this century : \" in point of fact , the first psychology labs had been set up by introspectionists , but they were completely taken over by behaviorists and introspection dumped . . . . linguists in the 50 \\'s were pretty much under the sway of behaviorists , and emotionally against introspectionism . . . . but then the enthusiasm generated by chomsky just swept away the behaviorist viewpoint , and along with it the contempt for the unguided use of speaker opinions . \" i thank all of my respondents ( cited below ) for their insightful and helpful remarks . i hope i have not distorted their positions in any serious way . marilyn silva respondents : dan alford , mark arnold , laurie bauer , kirk belnap , tony bex , scott delancey , jakob dempsey , susan ervin - tripp , georgia green , larry hutchinson , ingo plag , jim jewett , jules levin , chris li , steve matthews , dan maxwell , micheal palmer , jeanmarie rouhier , dale russell , mary ellen ryder , carson schutze , linda shockey , jacques steyn , and one respondent who prefers to remain anonymous',\n",

( michael newman , karl v . teeter , mechthild reh , european cases : generally , the intention was more the emancipation from latin and / or to give the own country a status as respectable as the roman empire .

( michael newman ) nynorsk : the rise and conception of nynorsk ( landsmaal ) in norway in the 1800s was part of the nationalist reaction to danish rule ( imperialism ) . that \\'s a long story , but nynorsk never succeeded in dominating norway , i \\' m afraid .

2 . can anyone provide me references to such work ? 3 . whether i get answers to # 1 or # 2 , what years are the \" formative years \" in which cutting off the child from the native language will have an effect on 2nd language learning ? 4 . does this age range have any relation to the \" critical period \" of language learning ? might there be a correlation that would tell us something about how and why kids learn languages differently and more easily than adults ? 5 . what are the different effects of cutting off a child from his native language at different ages / stages in language formation ? it seems pretty obvious that at the earliest years , \" 2nd language \" learning would asymptotically approach identity with the learning of the first language . 6 . when 1st and 2nd languages have contrasting features , it would seem that these kids would provide especial insight into ug models with parameters , in addition providing some clue as to when and how the parameters are set . has anyone looked at this ? 7 . what is the long-term language prognosis for such kids ? 7 to 11 years of language difficulty , when the difficulty often goes unnoticed ( or at least the fact that the difficulty is due to language problems - the adoptive parent who posted gave a detailed chronicle of her daughter \\'s varying problems from adoption at age 4 until 5th grade when the parent finally came to find out why her daughter was having problems even though she spoke english fluently ) - this seems likely to have severe long-term effects . 8 . my kids and all others i know of have completely lost the native language except for word isolates . do such kids relearn their native language any easier when they get older ? again , looking at contrasting features that such kids have difficulty relearning might tell us a lot about \" parameter setting \" especially when the difficulties do not match those of others acquiring the language as a 2nd langusge with no prior experience in the language . kids cut off from the native language would seem more likely to give clear data on this . 9 . are the effects of being cut-off from one \\'s native language different in kids like mine ? my kids were cut off from the native language only incompletely - they still had each other to talk to , in addition to my wife and my rudimentary self-teaching - but all of this continued exposure to the native language was impoverished both in vocabulary and grammar . ) russian remained the language of our household for most of the kids \\' first year here , and i quickly came to understand the differences in language at differing ages . i could understand and communicate with my kids quite well ( and fluently ) in russian after about a month , but still cannot understand even a slow talking russian adult . the types of errors kids tolerate ( and make - my kids often had the \\' wrong \\' declensional ending on irregular words ) seem quite different from what adults accept . 10 . are there any english language discussions about child language acquisition in russian kids ? ( i \\' m sure there are russian language sources , but i would never get through them . ) i would like to know what the typical russian child at the age my kids were adopted would typically have mastered in features like declensions , numbers , perfective / imperfective distinctions , and proper use of cases - things that i have n\\'t mastered well enough to be able to extract from relistening to tapes thaty i made while they still spoke russian fluently . lojbab lojbab @ access . digex . net bob lechevalier , president , the logical language group , inc . 2904 beau lane , fairfax va 22031-1303 usa 703-385 - 0273 for the artificial language loglan / lojban , see ftp . cs . yale . edu / pub / lojban or see lojban www server : href = \" http : / / xiron . pc . helsinki . fi / lojban / \"',\n",

( 1 ) a : i \\' m afraid there is n\\'t much i can help you with . b : _ in other words _ , you do n\\'t want to be bothered . although the interpretation process of ( 1 ) is very close to what is called \" conventional \" use , i . e . it might be processed spontaneously , without any inferential process in the hearer \\'s mind , b guesses a \\'s real intent , which is not directly inferred from a \\'s utterance , but indirect - ly from a \\'s implicature . in order for b to necessitate iow , b exploits his / her background assumption / encyclopedic knowledge , implicating that a is busy now , or a does n\\'t feel at ease with b . let the implicature just explained be c , then a sequential flow of consciousness / inferential process such as a $ @ \" * ( jc $ @ \" * ( jb emerges . iow is a visible index of the hearer \\'s implicature-interpretation process . speaker / hearer \\'s background assumption varies between common sense and the knowledge which is only valid between the speaker and hearer . ( 2 ) a : i love schubert \\'s late piano sonatas . b : _ in other words _ , you do n\\'t like the beethoven sonatas ? iow in ( 2b ) is derived by the use of a restricted set of background assumption in which b has already admired the beethoven sonatas . b assumes that a is also an admirer of beethoven , but contrary to b \\'s assumption a declares an admiration for schubert . so , b feels criticism in a \\'s words . b \\'s background assumption becomes an old information , conflates a \\'s new information and enables iow to create a = b . \" non - conventional \" , rather complicated use of iow is the following . ( 3 ) a : i \\' m going to kill you . b : _ in other words _ , you \\'d like it if i moved my car . for example , b \\'s car stands in the way of a \\'s car , so that a gets infuriated at b . the situation like the above gets a to utter such harsh words ; kill you . a \\'s real intent , in this case implicature / implication , is \" i \\' m going to kill you if you do n\\'t move your car \" , or simply \" move your car \" , which is labelled as c again . b , beginning with iow , paraphrases c by b \\'s own words . again in order for b to use iow , h / she must infer that a assumes / implicates c . background assumption mitigates b \\'s processing effort . if not , b processes too much effort and cannot interpret a \\'s words . b \\'s job here is to process the flow of the dialogue like a $ @ \" * ( jc $ @ ! a ( jb . b \\'s failure to process / infer the flow of the dialogue sometimes occurs . ( 1 \\' ) a : i \\' m afraid there is n\\'t much i can help you with . b \\' : ? _ in other words _ , you need to be helped . in the context where a really needs help , s / he does n\\'t bother to say that s / he can\\'t help b \\' . if a \\'s hands are full of the parcels and he visibly needs help , so that s / he says s / he can\\'t help b \\' , there is a possibility of b \\' saying it is you who need to be helped . however , this is a very insulting comment , because b \\' actually implies that if you can\\'t help me , you are not a capable person . so , you are the one who needs help . another completely misled example of inference is the following . ( 4 ) a : sorry , i can\\'t help you now , because i \\' m busy . b : * _ in other words _ , you \\' re busy . unacceptability of b comes from a \\'s words _ because i \\' m busy _ , where a has already spoken out his own implicature c . mere repetition cannot be allowed in iow \\'s case . if something extra can be implied in b \\'s response , type of ( 4 ) is ok . ( 5 ) a : sorry , i can\\'t help you now . b : _ in other words _ , you can\\'t . ( - ) \\' you really can\\'t . \\' ) in summary , an utterance \" a . in other words , b \" has an inferential process / hearer \\'s interpretive process \" a $ @ \" * ( jc ; in other words c $ @ ! a ( jb \" . iow can be campared with \\'s o \\' and \\' then , \\' etc . the following results are the above contributors \\' reactions . ( * ) means that there are some who judge a sentence acceptable and others unacceptable . \\' so \\' : $ @ ! ! ( j ( 6 ) a . there was $ 5 in his wallet . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } he had n\\'t spent all the money . b . she \\'s your teacher . { _ so _ / ( * ) _ in other words _ } you must respect her . $ @ ! !

( j ( 8 ) tom ate condemned meat . { _ so _ / * _ in other words _ } he felt ill . $ @ ! ! ( j ( 9 ) bill insulted mary . { _ so _ / _ in other words _ } she left . in contrast with resultative \\'s o \\'s \\' in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , two \\'s o \\'s \\' in ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are sequential . in the case of iow , one is ok and the other is out . ( 9 ) can be interpreted that bill \\'s insulting mary always leads to her leaving ( here ) , so that iow is permitted . iow in ( 8 ) is n\\'t ok because eating condemned meat always equals to his feeling ill , in which case iow in such situation is redundant / meaningless / uninformative . \\' then \\' : $ @ ! !

( \" ) . re-editing , adding and deleting labels labels can be re-edited , new labels can be added anywhere in the signal , and labels can be deleted individually or for an entire signal . reproduce labeled segment while the label is open for editing , you can play the selected portion of the signal by doing command - y . if you \\' re labeling a selection , and if you \\' ve set the audio to play signal selections , you \\' ll hear the segment which you \\' re about to label . align labels you can choose any of nine different vertical positions for placing labels . when you close a label with a click in the close rectangle or with return , the label automatically \" snaps \" to the nearest standard position . save labels the label information is saved as a tab - delimited text file with the extension \" . lbl \" . it is stored in the same folder as the signal file . label format the label format is in the public domain and is fully documented . it is available on the signalyze servers ( see below ) . transparent saving and opening open file operations on signal files that have accompanying \" . lbl \" text files cause the label information to be read into signalyze . save file operations on signals with labeling information automatically saves the labels in the same folder as the signal . save file operations for signals without labeling information erases whatever label file may have existed in the folder . label in phonetics you can use any phonetic or normal font in the labels . however for phonetics , it is recommended stick to sigpalfont ( the shareware font supplied with signalyze ) . sigpalfont preserves the numbers and angular brackets you need to indicate labeling levels , which is usually not possible with other phonetic fonts . search by label or by level you can search for labels using either a given labeling level or the label \\'s name . you can specify two separate search patterns . switch between the two patterns with the shift-lock key . more info and demo information on signalyze version 3 . 0 is available as follows : by ftp : ftp macfl4082 . unil . ch or ftp 130 . 223 . 104 . 31 login anonymous by gopher server : name of machine : gopher . unil . ch , find \" europe \" and \" switzerland \" , select \" university of lausanne \" , select \" autres gophers de l3unil \" , select \" faculte des lettres \" , select \" laboratoire d3analyse informatique de la parole ( laip ) \" , select \" speech analysis and speech synthesis \" , select \" signalyze \" prof . eric keller ( new email address : eric . keller @ imm . unil . ch ) laboratoire d \\' analyse / / ^ | | | | = = \\\\ \\\\ informatique de la parole ( laip ) / / / \\\\ | | | | | | lettres , universite de lausanne / / / / \\\\ \\\\ | | | | = = / / ch-1015 lausanne , switzerland / / / / = = = \\\\ \\\\ | | | | fax + 41 21 6924639 / + 41 21 692 4510 / / = = = = / / \\\\ \\\\ | | | | \" . 6 . ucla - uppsala analysis package ( to run on macrecorder files ) \" write to : software manager , phonetics lab , linguistics dept , ucla , los angeles , ca 90024-1543 for our order form . it \\'s $ 5 for just this disk . \" ( peter ladefoged ) 7 . gw instruments soundscope ( formerly macspeechlab ii ) ( mac ) \" more able to be tailored to individual uses than csl , but also a little clumsier and slower than csl . i think it runs about $ 3000 . \" ( alex francis ) c ) for unix 1 . xwaves + it costs around $ 5000 and the manufacturer is : \" entropic research laboratory , inc . 600 pennsylvania ave . , se washington dc 20003 usa \" ( franke ingolf ) 2 . dsp ( it has the same specifications with the sfs that has been presented above , about dos / windows ) . 3 . sfs ( it has the same specifications with the sfs that has been presented above , about dos / windows ) . 4 . digital ears no more information , only the name of the manufacturer , i . e . metaresearch 5 . ogi speech \" this is free ! ! ! i have never used it professionally , but while working at los alamos nat \\' l . labs i did get a chance to play with it . it comes with a good manual , and works with a number of different sound-file types , and can be configured for a number of different platforms ( sun & sgi ) . . . . it needs some additional hardware . \" ( alex francis ) . 6 . entropic sps software that runs through the xwaves + package . i do not know its prise ; also , i did not understand if it is a latest software improvement of xwaves + . \" address : entropic research laboratory , inc . 600 pennsylvania ave . , se washington dc 20003 usa \" ( franke ingolf ) additional information : read , buder & kent .

( the data for the english list is , apart from some editing , taken from tony woodbury \\'s posting ( see vol-5 - 1239 ) ) . granted not everything white in the listings given is snow , how can we comment on the quotation above ? at least , the writer should have told the reader why so many snowy words of english do not count as snow , or , perhaps , that eskimo in his opinion has no cover term , where english does have one . as it stands , however , it should make everybody very cautious about obtaining data of any language - - - including , obviously , their own - - - by way of secondary sources . likewise , how much do the manymany ` facts \\' drawn from ` exotic \\' ( i . e . , not very well documented ) languages count , which , for example , phonologists like to decorate their elaborate articles with ? two , i do n\\'t really get the point in excluding words like cornice from a snowy list . now if there are people out there who use the word primarily to denote some sort of snow formation and feel the word is in its * architectural * meaning of rather metaphorical nature , what \\'s the point in telling them they \\' re ` really \\' wrong ? in german , waechte , flocke and harsch might very well be derived from some other morphemes . in fact , this only tells us eskimo is not very well documented . i guess a lot of those words the hoax claims as semantically primitive would turn out much more connected to the rest of the vocabulary had we only the relative wealth of historical data we have for the indoeuropean languages . back to german again , flocke to me primarily denotes not ` something flaky \\' but rather precisely ` a snowflake \\' , and all other usages seem to be derived from that . harsch seems to be connected with harsch ` harsh \\' ; but used as a noun , what other denotation but that kind of slighly melted and frozen snow does it have ? loipe is the kind of tracks skiers use in their discipline and , i guess , not a ` very german \\' word - - - but disregarding borrowed words is just as silly as looking down on adopted children . anyway , there seems to be a need for that word . it \\'s snowy , very specialized , and , for my feeling , totally unconnected with any other word in german . of course i might be totally wrong ( and loipe is derived from ( ski ) laufen ` to run ( to ski ) \\' ) . now there \\'s the point . linguists are looking , on the one hand , into history to find out what really happened and try to extrapolate people \\'s minds to describe what \\'s really going on . if there \\'s someone with a lot of waechten and cornices and flakes on his mind , but with no connection to other non-snowy words for him , this is a fact of that ideolect . of course , as soon some linguist comes along and tells him the historical truth , behaviour and concepts of the speaker might change . . . even if in fact it was some sort of folk-etymology he absorbed when listening to the linguist : - ) . folk - etymology is there because it is a way we can imagine things to be . . . so , what layer of this person \\'s brain is it that synchronic word counting is claiming to acount for , and how historical a derivation is allowed or necessary in historical linguistics ? finally , i would like to point out that apart from some pretty specialized words having to do woth snow , rain is another phenomenon languages may have more or less to say about . in german , for example , you have niesel and nieselregen , denoting a very light rain or spray . there seem to be no other uses or compounds for this word apart from es nieselt , however , and no immediately related , more basic word niesel could be said to be derived from . so , we have wasser , regen , niesel , and more . eskimo does n\\'t appear that much outlandish any more , does it ? quotation taken from : trudgill , peter : _ sociolinguistics : an introduction _ . penguin books . 1974 wolfgang lipp castor @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de i52023 @ sakura . kudpc . kyoto-u . ac . jp',\n",

[ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as \" a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords \" ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of \" stage whispered \" speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a \" shouted \" whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that \" in languages such as english \" ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it \\'s rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com',\n",

( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in \" their \" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a \" crazy \" comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say \\' lexical items \\' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .',\n",

do linguists prefer traditional print media , or is there any interest in accepting knowledge from the computer screen ? 2 . ) is there any interest in publishing works which contain not only text but also images and sound ? what ideas are there on how to publish these scientific works ? 3 . ) who has experience using cds in the field of linguistics ? this survey is intended to serve as a basis for developing a concept for a new enterprise in the media services sector , which should provide next year \\'s young linguistically oriented post-graduate students a platform from which to work independently . i would like to thank you in advance for your answers and ideas . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ liebe linguist leser , in den letzten jahren hat sich die arbeitswelt vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert . fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet , der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen des kennenlernens der wirkungsweise dieser geraete , einen enormen arbeitsvorteil darstellt . dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere in der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung , verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten . so werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern , artikeln , diplom - und magisterarbeiten bereits heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich als eine datei vor . neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern , bildsequenzen und tonaufnahmen in eine niederschrift moeglich . so kann z . b . eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachliches experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahmen enthalten , aber auch bildaufnahmen der artikulierenden organe , wie mund und unterkiefer ; damit ist dieses experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfalls durchgefuehrt werden . es ist also moeglich , in vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung , auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger zu speichern . um diese mengen an daten , die durch die kombination von text , bild und ton entstehen , zu archivieren , bewaehrt sich immer mehr die cd als speichermedium . viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf cd . neben der moeglichkeit einer multi - media darstellung von wissen , hat die cd aber noch einen weiteren vorteil : aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer cd und der riesigen menge an speicherplatz wird es moeglich , publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern zu veroeffentlichen , als es mit herkoemmlichen journalen und buechern moeglich ist . hier ergibt sich fuer junge wissenschaftler , aber auch fuer renommierte die moeglichkeit , ihre niederschriften an die oeffentlichkeit zu bringen , die bisher , bedingt durch preis und ` chancenlosigkeit \\' , eher in der schublade verschwanden . mit diesem hintergrund versehen , wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten , inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse an folgenden themen zeigen : 1 . ) gibt es eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multi - media technik . greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck , oder besteht auch ein interesse an der wissensaufnahme durch den bildschirm . 2 . ) interessiert sich jemand fuer eine veroeffentlichung eigener arbeiten , die neben text auch bild und ton enthalten . welche vorstellungen gibt es ueber eine solche art und weise der publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten . 3 . ) wer hat schon erfahrungen in der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von cd \\'s gesammelt ?

) for diachronic purposes . fn : \" could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? \" bw : should it ? the immediate ancestor of the romance languages is not latin but proto - romance . svo ? what about the exceptions , e . g . , french j \\' ai rien fait etc . are n\\'t they hints to certain historical complications . also aux inversion in standard french , e . g . , sont-ils venus ? standard french aux inversion is probably of germanic origin , not found elsewhere in romance . as for reconstruction of case ( cf . latin / english ) , with possible implications for earlier word order possibilities , case inflections remain on ( third person ) object clitics in all romance languages . when we consider deviations from svo word order in romance languages , we may suspect that the notion of \" basic \" word order is a villain to the extent that it invites the analyst to disregard less frequent or syntactically restricted word orders . this is not safe in internal reconstruction of syntax , while the most revealing procedure may be to do internal reconstruction of syntax within a language before using the comparative method to reconstruct within groups of languages genetically related by other criteria . in fact , the last point above is what is usually done , and is probably the only proper way to proceed , given the intent of the comparative method . always reconstruct a basic vocabulary first , on the basis of sound correspondences - - to justify genetic relationship among the languages . then consider syntactic comparison . problems with this necessary procedure will emerge in following discussion , but it remains necessary unless you want to reconstruct the syntactic evolution of a geographical area rather than of a genetic family . the latter may be a useful complement to assumed genetic reconstruction , but i think it is too digressive an idea for me to pursue below . now , what about preverbal object clitics in romance ? another hint of complications to the svo concept of romance . preverbal object clitic means ov - - but i suppose \" basic \" means when o has a noun not a pronoun as the head . and what aout the fixing of multiple object clitic order in romance ? e . g . , case order versus person ( inherent topicality ) order . that can\\'t be reconstructed for latin because the clitics did not arise as distinct entities until proto - romance at the earliest . can a single or preferred clitic order be reconstructed for proto - romance , e . g . , dat-acc ( invariant in spanish and , i think , rumanian , but acc-dat seems to be older in french , now remaining only for third persons , i . e . , no inherent topicality difference therefore earlier case ordering remains - - french acc-dat may reflect germanic influence as well ? ) ? or did fixed clitic orders originally arise independently in various areas of romance ? in any case , how can we avoid the comparative method in addressing the problem of the origin of object clitic order in romance ? in sum , i think that the origin / s and evolution of fixed multiple object clitic orders in romance is a legitimate issue , and that it cannot be solved without recourse to the comparative method ( among others , of course ) . therefore , the comparative method cannot be dismissed in syntactic reconstruction . fn : \" should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? \" bw : newmeyer \\'s reference to proto - germanic reveals even more than romance that \" basic \" word order is a villainous concept for reconstruction in this case , as if \" basic \" word orders can be compared across related languages to reconstruct \" proto-basic \" word orders , such that \" minor \" word orders can be ignored or reconstructed as \" proto-minor \" word orders . one principle which emerges from our knowledge of the historical record is that word order change does n\\'t work that way , i . e . , word orders cannot be compartmentalized as \" basic \" and \" minor \" for diachronic purposes . principle : if we want to develop tools and principles for syntactic reconstruction , we will really have to consider the functions served by the various word orders at different times , and detect changes in their functions diachronically . in other words , word order change in a language must be studied in the context of the totality of functions of all its word orders at any given time . the difference between such a study and the study of change in \" basic \" word order , if the latter means anything at all , is analogous to the study of phonetic change and phonemic change . if analysts argue about the notion of \" basic \" word order , this is analogous to arguing about different concepts of the phoneme , and not about agreed upon linguistic facts . the fallacy of reconstructing \" basic \" word order for proto - germanic on the basis of the \" basic \" word order in current germanic becomes obvious according to the above principle because of the sov word order in subordinate clauses in continental germanic . and even this is not as invariant a property of the oldest texts as it is of the later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german and dutch . english also clues us in to inversion by its many remnants , even without historical texts which reveal more similarities to continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following a subordinate clause or adverb , still common in the av bible . including english but excluding gothic which mirrors to the extent possible the new testament greek syntax from which it was translated , the earliest texts in germanic show , as far as i know , a tendency relatively favorable to verb-final in subordinate clauses , but much variation , later eliminated in the continental standards . this leads to arguments about whether or not the sov tendency was the break-up of an earlier more general indo - european sov tendency ( or earlier fixation ? ) which died in english and scandinavian ( including the still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even for simplistic functional arguments for the evolution of svo in germanic , so that the argument would have to be : it started as a reaction to the increasing unreliability of case distinction but spread for social reasons to languages that did n\\'t need it . such an argument does not strike me as at all unreasonable ! ) . [ although i excluded gothic above , because of its malleable accommodation to greek syntax , its deviations from nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is the absence of a definite article , despite its occurrence in nt greek as well as in all other germanic languages . if gothic translation was totally serious about imitating nt greek syntax in all cases it could have adopted an unstressed demonstrative to imitate the greek article , as later germanic did ( in a sense ) . the most important question about gothic syntax is : is the malleability of its syntax innovative from proto - germanic ? - - if so , we will probably never know in what ways the gothic translations of nt greek stretched the limits of that malleability , and distorted the colloquial functions of word order in spoken gothic or more generally in the germanic of the third century . if sov was invariant in some ancestor , then why did it deteriorate in germanic ? at least as puzzling , how / why / when did germanic get aux inversion , even in yes / no questions . all indo - european languages show wh fronting for wh questions , so is there any reason to believe the proto - language did not . would i be buying what newmeyer is questioning with the preceding argument , cf . fn : \" i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : \" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . \" \" bw : [ why with \" increasing frequency \" ? is the implication that copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible than they used to be ( cf . the discussion of the spread of rumors about the number of eskimo words for snow ) , or that syntax is driving historical linguistics to pot ? ] to be safe , i guess ancillary arguments come in , like : considering how areally widespread the ie languages are , is it likely that the unanimity of wh first questions across ie is not reflective of the proto-language ? ok , so maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got a better explanation for the facts ? or reason to ignore them ? ) , but why aux inversion in germanic questions . and does the application of inversion to yes / no questions mean that there was a question marker in initial position ( wh question position ) with yes / no questions , as in \" what / hullo , are you kidding me ? \" ( such a marker \" ibai \" is found in gothic whenever the new testament greek original has \" me : \" ) . do n\\'t get me wrong . i \\' m not suggesting that an initial yes / no question-marker was a necessary condition for the inversion innovation in germanic . i \\' m only observing that there was the option of such a marker , and anticipating ( if indeed it has not already been suggested ) that some analysts who are overly formal in their approaches to syntax might suppose the necessity of such a marker to motivate a mechanical generalisation of inversion from wh to yes / no questions . again , because such in - version occurs in all germanic should we not reconstruct it for proto - germanic . . qualification on all : it \\'s variable in gothic where it \\'s variable in nt greek : pronoun subjects usually do not invert with the verb , noun subjects usually do . ] a practical point is that , as far as i know , there is an issue about the differentiation of germanic into anything like the modern descendents before the 4 - 5th century . thus , if aux inversion goes back that far , does it matter if it spread from one germanic area to another or if it was part of proto - ( west ? ) germanic ? all innovations must spread before we recognise them as innovations in the language ( or dialect ) . historical linguistics does not study the evolution of the idiolect ( if such a concept as \" evolution of the idiolect \" is even coherent ) . finally , about typological arguments . when morphology-as - fossilized syntax and universal-typology of word order congealed in the early 1970s , some suggested that even before ie was sov it was vso . why ? because subject marking inflection follows the verb : v - s , get it ? inevitably , then , some suggested that celtic maintains the most archaic \" basic \" word order among the ie languages . this is another excess in diachronic application of ( whatever ) the notion of basic word order . the principal objection raised was that it is not obvious ( and even unlikely ) that only basic word orders morphologise . ( in fact , they may be least likely to morphologise . ) considering that s represents an unstressed anaphor in v - s , s might be in a minor word order position . [ and note that if basic word order means when the arguments are nominal , not pronominal , then discourse frequency is not criterial of basic , since at least most subject arguments are pronominal , if not merely inflectional . furthermore , if \" basic \" only counts the relative frequency of subject nominals , it is based on something which is quite rare in discourse : subject nominals ] . in any case , subject inflection following the verb stem is a widespread eurasian areal feature , extending into africa in semitic and various other branches of afro - asiatic . to some this might be taken as a clue to the correctness of nostratic and other super-family notions , to others an indication of an extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless of genetic relationship ( cf . the famous balkan area ) . still others might opt for coincidence . various other languages also have this feature , e . g . , kanuri in west africa and various new world languages . ( welcome to nostratic ? ) questions about the functions of position after the verb in so-called sov languages are raised by v - s inflectional order . the typological implications of this go beyond my current knowledge , although i dimly remember that various eurasian sov languages are different according to whether or what function post-verb - al position has in such languages . this is obvious , for example , in the contrast between eurasian sov languages ( with differences amongst themselves ) and the so-called sovx west african languages , where x is an adpositional phrase ( with complications about the origin of adpositional phrases in such languages which i will refrain from discussing here ) . since so many eurasian sov languages are also v - s inflectional languages , i do not know if there are sov languages which have a \" minor \" postverbal position for an anaphoric subject ( such that it turns up in other positions in certain constructions , so that we can demonstrate that it is not an inflection ) . maybe typology of relevant amerind languages will help solve this problem . but maybe we may also anticipate the reappearance of the party-spoiling question about the representativeness of curent language types to possible ( and former ) language types . no doubt an unwelcome ( and unhelpful ? ) thought to many . in this context it seems worth mentioning that mathematical probability arguments for various word orders , as i have seen them practiced , are not impressive , because of faults in their initial assumptions . for example , as far as i know , they invariably assume the validity of counting number of languages , regardless of the genetic relationship or areal contiguity of the languages counted . this seems unsound to me , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . for example , we find ( i think ) that the eurasian area , consisting of umpteen and umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring the position of the verb as an independent variable ) . then in the new world we find large areas of contiguous s . . . o order , and separate areas of o . . . s order . maybe we should be calculating mathematical probability on the basis of contiguous area rather than number of languages . the surprising result might be that o . . . s is more probable than s . . . o ( where area is an independent variable , not individual language , of course . ) i \\' m not sure what the implications of this might be , but one might be that o . . . s might have once been a more likely ordering strategy than it is now , and that the predominance of s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely the result of areal spread . [ if the spread of s . . . o is old enough , its predominance might even be the result of an absolute increase in the number of \" languages \" in the world all together . however , this is n\\'t really relevant to my criticim of the way probability arguments have been applied to syntactic typology , only to the historical implications of adequate assumptions about language typology . in fact , i \\' ll leave this discussion with the already widely accepted suggestion that strategies for information distribution in the clause , esp . in terms of old / new , are more relevant to typology than such problematic notions for cross-linguistic comparison as subject and object . similarly , for example , i think that in eurasia , agent . . . patient / theme order largely cuts across ergative and accusative languages , even though ergative languages would have patient / theme , or whatever term you want , as subject . to this extent , s . . . o cannot be universal even in eurasia , without confusing \" accusative \" definitions of subject and object , where subject status is consistent with case-marking , and \" ergative \" definitions , where case-marking is more closely tied to transitivity role than to the mushy cross-linguistic concept of subject . ] fn : \" and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . \" bw : i think the thrust of fn \\'s suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( on the basis of older ideas about creoles ? ) . however , questions remain in my mind about conditions under which these things happen . within monolingual areas ( or among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types of ? ) syntactic strategies seem to have the potential to spead quite quickly , perhaps almost as quickly as new words and expressions , while comparable speed is not generally observed for phonological change ( and is probably \" unlikely or impossible \" , as newmeyer puts it , for both internal linguistic and social reasons - - in fact , i think \" unlikely \" is more accurate than \" impossible \" depending on the nature of the particular type of phonological change , and i have an example of possible single-generation phonological change in the current english of the african americans in new york city area , but i do not have sufficient data to make this possibility or its implications worth discussing here - - until i get to the section in labov \\'s new book where he discusses recent innovations in the chicago vowel system i will not be sure if he has other examples ) . however , to the extent that language-contact propels \" cataclysmic \" syntactic change ( in the historical record ) fn \\'s suggestion is not so clear . for example , english in east la ( a mexican american community ) is more immediately strikingingly different from adjacent english dialects on the phonological than on the syntactic level . and that applies to monolingual speakers of east la english as well as spanish - english bilinguals , and to various phonological segments as well as intonational contours ] . in understanding historical syntactic evolution , it is most often difficult to distinguish internal evolution from language contact ( hence the sour regard for substratal theories during the late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration of neogrammarian achievements ) - - and then there is also jakobson \\'s caution that language contact might not permit evoluton that is not internally possible anyway , rather that it can only promote one possible direction of change as opposed to other possible directions which might flourish under other external circumstances . this too i consider problematic as a blanket statement , but a major consideration to keep in mind as a possible constraint on change in most reconstructive expeditions into the unknown past . enough . these are my thoughts about the problems of using the comparative method alone to reconstruct syntax . but nobody would suggest something so foolish as not enlisting all possible tools of reconstruction , including internal and typological in addition to comparative . conversely , it would be equally foolish to shun the comparative method as a reconstructive tool . in any case , the notion of basic word order is not helpful to syntactic reconstruction , if not of doubtful value as an autonomous observation about the synchronic state of any language as well . i mean it \\'s ok to observe that english and french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even more than english - - not least because of the former \\'s preferred question formation strategies ) , but without further discussion that does not mean that their syntaxes are \" basically \" the same , in any insightful or interesting ( to coin an adjective ) sense . i would like readers to react to any of the points i have made above , not least of all the accuracy of the facts i have suggested for various languages , since i am not an expert in the areas of most of the facts i have presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian and new world areal syntactic characteristics . benji',\n",

( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the \" unmarked \" case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of \\' ask \\' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation \" going to the bathroom \" . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it \\'s implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of \" role identity \" , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( \" a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german \" ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as \" pragmatic roles \" . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an \" implicit controller \" , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book \" kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive \" published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker \\'s intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany',\n",

as a concrete example , take the fact , recently cited by poser , that all the muskogean evidence in greenberg \\'s book has been found to be tainted by data errors ( geoffrey d . kimball , a critique of muskogean , \" gulf \" , and yukian material in _ language in the americas _ , ijal 58 ( 1992 ) , 447-501 ) . i can imagine how one might want to maintain that even this total collapse of the case on muskogean merely puts us back in a state of being neutral , a priori , on whether muskogean languages are related to other amerindian languages , or to nostratic for that matter . anti - greenberg amerindianists are perfectly prepared to agree that the amerind languages might have descended from a common source now lost . that \\'s neutrality . but suppose we move from that neutrality to the position that we will assume as a default that muskogean is amerind , and so are all the languages of south america , and indeed , that amerind is related to sino - tibetan and both to indo - european and thus nostratic and all of the above to khoisan . . . let us assume for the sake of argument that the world \\'s languages are all genetically related ; but let us take this to be an empirical assumption - - not just a willingness to reject the closet racism that poser says ruhlen once alleged in his critics , or a yearning to find universal brotherhood , but an assumption against which evidence can in principle count . now , what sort of linguistic evidence would count , for greenberg and ruhlen and illich - svitych , as disproving the inclusion of muskogean or any other family in in the conjectural ( though tentatively assumed ) proto - gaeic ? that is , what sort of data pattern or configuration of phonological and grammatical properties could suffice to make the macrocomparativists throw in the towel and go outside to meet the press and concede defeat ? there ought to be some imaginable scenario that would end up with ruhlen telling a group of reporters from the stanford daily and american scientist and other supermarket tabloids , \" well , we thought we could sustain the whole proto - gaeic thing , but that set of paradigms on haida has us beat ; we \\' ve had to concede the haida case ; according to our tests , haida is unrelated to the other human languages . \" ( much scope for new press attention here : \" haida indians are aliens from space , top expert admits . \" ) but what sort of scenario would it have to be , to get the greenberg camp to admit that it was in grave trouble on some relatedness claim ? to be fair , orthodox comparativists might well say that if you put it like this , no answer should be expected . one can argue that a certain methodology applied to a certain set of data yield no evidence for relatedness between burushaski and bushman , but not that it refutes such a relatedness . a positivist view of historical linguistics would see it as maintaining hypotheses about verifiable relatednesses in a very particular form : when i say that german \" pfennig \" comes from an earlier germanic form with initial \" p \" that will be seen in languages like english with no history of a high german sound shift , i am counted as having been supported by the observation that english speakers say \" penny \" ; if the form turned out to be \" twenny \" i would be in trouble ; given german \" pfund \" i am committed to something like \" pund \" in english , and ( given the great english vowel shift ) the discovery of \" pound \" is more good news for me ; and so on . the predictions i am making are about an indefinitely extensible set of pairs ( ger : pfxxx , eng : pxxx ) . now , the falsity of one of these could conceivably taken to refute brittle forms of the hypothesis that english cognates of german pf-words always begin with p - , but it is n\\'t nearly enough to be counterevidence to the whole english / german relatedness claim , of course . that claim would not be given up unless there was a complete collapse of all the evidence : if \" pound \" was established textually to have been a coinage by a novelist who had never heard german , if \" penny \" was shown to be borrowed from italian \" penne \" during a period when pasta had been used for small change , and then all the other sound correspondences started collapsing as well . i \\' m asking this : if the 100 % collapse of greenberg \\'s muskogean evidence , as alleged by kimball , does not count as a complete collapse of the case that muskogean is included in amerind ( hence , a fortiori , of the case that it is in proto - gaeic ) , then i think i need some help in understanding what could be evidence against that inclusion . there had better be something . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + | g e o f f r e y k . p u l l u m * pullum @ cats . ucsc . edu | | stevenson college , university of california , santa cruz , california 95064 | | ( 408 ) 459-4705 * messages ( 408 ) 459-2555 / 2905 * fax ( 408 ) 459-3334 | + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +',\n",

( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of \" closeness \" of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . \" the comparative method \" currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term \" the comparative method \" , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word \" the \" were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term \" comparative methods \" . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson',\n",

( which could also explain why gaelic has taken the opposite trend and started marking vowel length where it never used to , since it is used so much nowadays by less than fully native speakers . . . ) . thoughts on these hypotheses would be gratefully received . but back to korean . . . this still seems like a very unusual situation to me . it seems likely and indeed it was suggested by some of the korean respondents that the original hangul did have a length marker , but i have found no evidence for this in my research on hangul . ( that \\'s why i posted the orginal query , and i ve just had another look at ledyard \\'s thesis on the topic . ) maybe i just need to do more careful research : pointers on this also gratefully received . a couple of points of clarification : the distinction between the monosyllabic vowel length \\' minimal pairs \\' does seem to be dying out ( though it is the fact that it previously existed but was not marked in the writing system at that time that i find odd ; could it be that the lack of orthographic representation contributes to its demise ? ? ) . but there is a clear distinction in the sound of the two syllable pairs . to my ears these distinction seems to be much more one of pitch accent than of length . and : when i said that native speakers dont easily identify vowel length , i didnt mean that they say \\' my language doesnt have a vowel length distinction \\' - which would indeed be a statement to be cautious of ! i meant they dont know which word is supposed to have the long vowel and which the short . this is consistent with information sent by native speakers that it is something taught in schools as a prescriptive rule well for anyone who has read this far , let me reward you by sharing with you this response from fran karttunen ( i hope she doesnt mind ) . i dont know exactly how to interpret it with respect to my questions above , but i \\' m sure there \\'s something in it for all of us ! \\' both the maya and the nahua ( speakers of unrelated mesoamerican languages ) had achieved a partially-syllabic approach to writing before the arrival of europeans in the first quarter of the 16th century . from what we can tell of their writing , both made some use of rhebus principles in which a drawing of thing , the name of which was similar rather than identical , was used to suggest the intended word / syllable . for instance , a drawing of a a bare bottom ( tzin-tli \" buttocks \" ) was used for the honorific suffix - tzin . likewise a drawing of a banner , pan-tli was used for locative - pan . these two examples are suffixes , but there are similar cases for initial syllables of nahuatl noun stems , for instance . vowel length , at least for nahuatl , is not taken into account in these cases . the honorific suffix today has the reflex of a long vowel in most modern dialects of nahuatl , making it homophonous with the stem of \" buttocks \" , but attestation from the sixteenth century consistently show them to contrast in vowel length ( short for the honorific , long for \" buttocks \" ) . same for \" banner \" ( long vowel ) versus the locative ( short ) . \\' thanks again to all respondents , who are listed below as acknowledgment .

that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally \\'s general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer \\'s statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer \\'s ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer \\'s second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the \" true \" or \" real \" work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter \\'s recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer \\'s point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : \" since it is clear that everybody \\'s first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . \" ( please note the words \" first approximation \" in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : \" on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . \" ( please note the words \" the only way \" and \" establish \" . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter \\'s criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) \" systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies \" may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the \" real work \" and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving \" nothing at all \" regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is \" real work \" . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally \" the real work \" . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser \\'s message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser \\'s mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser \\'s paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser \\'s message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg \\'s errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg \\'s method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg \\'s methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are \" obviously \" cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article \" common pathways of illumination \" by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) \" chance lookalikes \" certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of \" chance lookalikes \" to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of \" substrate \" and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg \\'s errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg \\'s original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether \" limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . \" please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser \\'s assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser \\'s supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg \\'s hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser \\'s conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as \" the \" ( read \" the only \" ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg \\'s data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the \" holy \" and the \" unclean \" , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser \\'s discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be \" necessary to exclude chance \" . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of \" the comparative method \" which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso \\'s contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled \" typology of historical change \" . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard \\'s nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson',\n",

far / text-so - far \" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in \" official \" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : -

theoretic approaches will be favoured over those approaches based on analogy with human cognitive processes , though mathematical discussions of such processes will be appropriate . the basic questions to be addressed include o classification of objects in a taxonomy : systemic classification , semantic indexing , partial-order sorting , description identification , and taxonomy maintenance . o efficient order , lattice , graph , and code theoretic operations on objects : subsumption , generalization , specialization , least common generalization , and greatest common specialization . o advanced uses of taxonomies : knowledge compression , knowledge compilation , and knowledge evolution . o using classified knowledge : classification as problem solving , classification as constraint satisfaction , and exploiting abstraction . o scalable techniques for large object databases o integration of data and knowledge base technologies the symposium will maintain a balance between theoretical issues and descriptions of implemented systems providing a balance between theory and practice . the focus of the symposium is on efficiency of retrieval , use and storage . authors ' information papers may not exceed 15 pages . shorter , substantive papers are welcome . authors are requested to submit five ( 5 ) copies of their paper . alternatively , electronic submissions ( by ftp or email ) of papers ( postscript output ) are encouraged . submission by ftp : please place in ftp . cs . rmit . edu . au incoming directory . authors are further requested to attach title pages to their submissions bearing their names , addresses , telephone numbers , fax numbers and e-mail addresses . in addition , authors are asked to include abstracts of approximately twenty ( 20 ) lines with each paper , and a list of short phrases descriptive of the content . papers must be postmarked on or before monday february 13 , 1995 . address : kruse c / o gerard ellis computer science dept . rmit gpo box 2476v , melbourne , vic 3001 australia email : ged @ cs . rmit . edu . au ph : 61 -

i think that the answer is in the negative . second , alexis is certainly right when he says that a refusal to admit lexical evidence will make impossible to prove that mandarin is related to cantonese or that vietnamese is related to khasi . even worse , we won\\'t be able to state that beijing mandarin is related to xi \\' an mandarin , or that hanoi vietnamese is related to saigon vietnamese , as nothing resembling est , sunt / ist , sind can be found in these closely related dialects . moreover , we would have to dismantle the families of north and north east asia as well , since their agglutinative morphology also does not exhibit anything of the kind ie does . therefore , continuing this claim logically to its end , we will have to state that there are around 50 unrelated languages in japan alone , because we have no possibility to prove the genetic relationship of various japanese dialects and subdialects , since they do not have a grammar like ie . there are cases when proof of genetic relationship is based mostly on grammar , but there are cases when it rests solely on lexical items , as well as there are lucky cases like ie when one can demonstrate the relatedness on the basis of both grammar and lexicon . absolutization of any of this cases may lead us to dismissal of pretty well established language families . the cases like \" proto _ english - french \" can actually be easily controlled by using basic voca - bulary in lexical comparisons : no matter how many romance words were borrowed b yenglish , its basic vocabulary is still germanic , which can be easily demon - strated , contrary to those who try to label the very idea of basic vocabulary as \" semantic primitive \" . 2 ) geoffrey pullum writes : ) i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , prefererably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? the same things as in case of lower-level comparisons : either lack of regular phonetic correspondences , or lack of enough number of cognates , representing basic vocabulary items and / or basic morphological markers , established on the basis of these regular correspondences . this is why i , not being amerindianist myself , cannot believe in amerind : greenberg did not present any correspondences at all , and his whole method of \" mass comparisons \" is in direct violation of traditional and conservative comparative methodology . therefore , i would side with greenberg opponents on this matter . but i believe that it is absolutely unfair to put illich - svitych in one company with greenberg and ruhlen , as geoffrey pullum does in his posting . illich - svitych work starts with charts of phonetic correspondences , which do work regularly throughout his 3 - volume work , and is , therefore , in sharp contrast with greenberg \\'s \" mass comparisons \" . the whole work , at least in the areas i can judge of ( altaic and uralic ) is done with painstaiking care and accuracy , reflecting the state of the art , contemporary to the time when his work was done ( sixties ) . may be the opponents of long-range compa - rison should at last familiarize themselves with works of illich - svitych , dolgopol \\'s kii and others , which as i believe represent a successful long-range comparative work ( though it does not necessarily mean that i agree with all illich - svitych \\'s proposals : many things remain to be done ) , rather then to repeat the groundless allegations in illich - svitych address , and come forward with some concrete arguments against his work , rather than general statements that illich - svitych \\'s work is like greenberg \\'s or that there is a ceiling to the comparative method . sincerely , sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu',\n",

we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n\\'t be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek \\' colonies \\' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain \\' areal \\' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can\\'t really speak of the \\' oddity \\' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means \\' odd \\' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia \\' langauges \\' , would n\\'t we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n\\'t vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the \\' parent \\' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can \\' prove \\' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the \\' unlikely \\' correspondences ( i . e . \\' ist / sind \\' and \\' est / sunt \\' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany',\n",

top-of - the-head posting about karamojong , i decided to make amends by doing a little research ( very little ) to check the rest of what i said . consider it a xmas gift . below is the relevant section of recent nilo - saharan classification ( sudanic : nilotic ) . it \\'s basically the same as greenberg ( 1963 ) with some refinements in further branching but no rearrangement of limbs . east sudanic has four branches , including eastern and western , then nilotic with three branches , including west , east and south . karamojong belongs to the east branch of the nilotic branch of east sudanic . it is therefore classified as closer to maasai ( maa - lotuko branch ) and bari ( bari branch ) than to the lwo branch of the west branch of nilotic , but no closer to kalenjin , a group in the south branch ( e . g . , nandi ) than to the west branch . the following is a relatively recent classification , such as found in schadeberg \\'s ( 1981 ) article on nilo - saharanisch . central sudanic : moru - madi - lugbara etc east sudanic : eastern : nubian western : tama , daju kuliak : ik , so nilotic : west : ( some call it north nilotic ) burun : idem nuer - dinka : idem lwoo : north : shilluk , anwak south : achooli , luo east : ( some call it central nilotic ) bari : bari , kakwa etc maa - lotuko : maasai etc teso - turkana : karamojong , jie etc south : kalenjin : nandi - markweta : nandi , tuken elgon : sapiny , pok okiek / dorobo : sogoo etc datoga : etc beside the bewildering array of east and west branches of branches down the sudanic line i can trace my inaccuracy to conolly \\'s mention of jie . as a language , jie , along with karamojong and various other languages such as teso , are part of the teso - turkana branch of east nilotic . however , in an earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is the name used for west nilotic ( or at least the current lwo and nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means \" people \" ( or \" ordinary people \" ) in most of the west nilotic languages , hence the classificational name . the dinka call themselves \" jieng \\' \" . i suspect that the east nilotic jie ( also spelled \" jiye \" ) is the same word , but i have n\\'t checked if the jie actually call themselves that . african language nomenclature is full of terms not used by the speakers themselves ( but often by sarcastic neighbors , so that , for example , while the dinka evidently see no stigma in their autonym , the achooli use the term somewhat like english uses the term \" the masses \" , cf . hoi polloi ) . just for fun let \\'s see how accurate what i said was about the numbers from one to ten are . we do n\\'t need six through nine , because they are compounds of five plus numbers under five . the data for most languages are restricted to what i happened to have within reach without doing library research . however , the data for bari and teso ( ateso , in my experience ) are from transcriptions of recordings i made a long time ago in east africa before i even knew how these languages were classified . i do n\\'t have published linguistic data on hand for them . in all cases i have simplified orthography for typographical ease ( losing information ) . for example , the \" h \" following a vowel refers to the retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position of that vowel . the nilotic languages have complex vowel systems with \" tense \" and \" lax \" subsystems . of course , lexical numbers by themselves do not prove anything about genetic af finities . nevertheless , some interesting patterns emerge to compare with the currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang \\' we : hn ang \\' wehnoh ang \\' wen ng \\' wan ng \\' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl the first consonant in \\' 5 \\' seems to be diagnostic of the distinctness of nuer - dinka from the lwoo group . otherwise , dinka \\' 1 \\' is wierd , and so is the first consonant of dinka \\' 10 \\' ( cf . dinka - nuer \\' 5 \\' ) , but not much wierder than a comparison of indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic \\' 4 - 5 \\' or slavic \\' 9-10 \\' ) . reconstruction is not difficult , although you do n\\'t have an accurate transcription of the vowel distinctions ( or tone ) . east and south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling \\' diopeti - bo akenge kow ( southern also \\' hal \\' ) 2 morehk iyere - re aeng lamma 3 msala : iu ~ li - uni somok siddah 4 ingwan iwong \\' wahn - ong \\' uan angwan afar 5 mukanad ikany imiet mut shan 10 pwahk itomony tomon taman tommon the numbers \\' 2 \\' and \\' 4 \\' are consistent with west nilotic . otherwise , lexicon appears to be areally defined . first maasai and nandi seem to have a cognate for west nilotic \\' 5 \\' . however , maasai is classified with bari and teso as east nilotic . thus , bari and teso seem to share an innovation for \\' 5 \\' which does not extend to maasai or south nilotic . meanwhile the cognacy of bari \\' 3 \\' with teso and maasai is questionable , and nandi \\' 3 \\' is beyond the pale . interestingly , my data for bari has \\' 10 \\' as given , while greenberg gives bari \\' 10 \\' as \" mere \" in one of his mass cognate sets ( p . 106 ) . \" pwahk \" fits in with the west nilotic set , but presumably g \\'s data comes from a published source . ( i have n\\'t loo ked at my data since i transcribed it - - several decades , but i relistened to my bari tape to make sure i had n\\'t transposed the word for \\' 10 \\' with some other word like \\' toothbrush \\' . ) by the way , teso is closely related to karamojong so i would expect the numbers to be similar , including the cushitic loan for \\' 10 \\' , but with doubts about whether karamojong \\' 5 \\' would follow the maasai or bari - teso pattern . ( gotta go to the library for this one . any volunteers ? ) the word for \\' 10 \\' in the other east and south nilotic languages was recognised by g as a loan from somali or one of the mutually intelligible galla languages of cushitic . that \\'s why i gave the somali numbers above . easy to see it would be a lot more difficult to argue for somali as nilotic than for the other languages [ uhm , if their other lexical correspondences behave like their numbers - - which they do . . . g actually uses the example of cushitic multiple of ten in maasai in his arguments against meinhof \\'s nilo - hamitic hypothesis . cushitic was part of \" hamitic \" in the older terminology ( \" afro - asiatic \" is g \\'s coinage for older \" semito - hamitic \" ) . . note nubian \\' 10 \\' below . . thus , g has been as sharp to use arguments about borrowing against his opponents as have his opponents against him . what to do ? east sudanic central sudanic nubian lugbara 1 we : rum aluh 2 awum iri 3 toskum na 4 kemsum su 5 dijum towi 10 dimnum muhdri wow ! numbers do n\\'t help unite nubian as a branch of east sudanic with nilotic . obviously other criteria were used . for superifical impression nubian \\' 10 \\' looks promising as cognate with south and most of east nilotic , and maybe it is , but that card has already been played non-genetically above -

- for comparison with \\' 10 \\' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for \" one \" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto -

( i get a lot of requests for both of these types of fonts , and i see requests for information on the list , too . ) i am interested in ftp sites for obtaining public domain / shareware fonts , along with addresses , etc . of people or organizations that create fonts for sale ( the copyrighted fonts - - the ones you can \\' t copy freely ) . i will compile a list of where to get the ftp fonts , and a separate section with a listing of who provides which copyrighted fonts , and how to obtain them . i will also download the fonts from ftp sites , and pass them on to whoever asks for them . one of the problems i encounter when i try to read the work of others , is the usage of different orthographies by different people . i would like to see a common ( within each language ) orthography for each of the languages we all study - - the smaller language groups quite often do n\\'t have a common orthography . ( i do n\\'t know if such a thing is even possible ; there may be too much disagreement on what a font for language _ _ _ _ _ should look like . we seem to disagree on just about every other topic , but that \\'s healthy , i think . ) if i could develop a repository for fonts , then , for example , i could write a paper about the cahuilla language and e-mail the paper anywhere in the world along with the font ( s ) necessary to read / print the paper . ( copyrighted fonts would have to be purchased from the source . ) others could do the same with \" their \" languages . often , when writing papers , and quoting the works of others , i need to write using a non-standard font , so i need to make it myself , then go back to my writing . i have n\\'t counted them , but i have a bunch of partial fonts for many languages , both orthography and ipa . however , these partially completed fonts are based on books written as far back as the 1800s . i seriously doubt that they represent current writing systems . i do n\\'t want to step on anybody \\'s toes , but i can develop a font for any language out there . i can do both truetype and postscript fonts for both the pc and macs . however , if somebody else has already done the work , it makes sense to use their fonts . why re-invent the wheel ? as far as naming the fonts i \\' ve created , i \\' ve been using the three-letter language codes from _ ethnologue : languages of the world _ , ed . barbara f . grimes , 12th ed . , 1992 . for example , my cahuilla orthography is c-chl . ttf ( truetype for pc ) , and my cahuilla ipa is c-chl - p . ttf . i recently responded to jan tent \\'s posting about yesterday , today , and tomorrow words . i sent her words in north american indian languages . she wrote back asking about some of the symbols i had used . if a common font set was available , i could have e-mailed her a font for her computer , and she could have read my reply with the native orthography and ipa pronunciations in the document i sent . to me , it seems that this would be useful to people . i \\'d like to hear others \\' opinions about such a project ( in addition to where to ftp or buy fonts ) . i would especially like to hear from the indigenous language speakers on this list , in addition to the linguists . so send me your information and opinions , even if the opinion is , \" chuck , you \\' re an idiot . scrap the whole idea . \" i \\' ll post a summary to the list if there \\'s enough interest , otherwise i \\' ll respond personally . if you need a font for a language you \\' re working on , let me know that , too . happy holidays , chuck coker work : ( 909 ) 882-2099 ( united states ) home : ( 909 ) 886-5035 ( united states ) e-mail : cjcoker @ csupomona . edu = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there have been no dragons in my life , only small spiders and stepping in gum . i could have coped with the dragons . - - anonymous ( but wise )',\n",

[ for those unfamiliar with the term , grammaticalization is , approximately , a type of gradual reanalysis that turns material that used to be more independent and lexical into material that is more dependent and grammatical . ] i \\' ve noticed that the discussion has focused on pronunciation and spelling as indicators of \" native speaker intuitions . \" another approach is to look at syntax . many speakers consider what wouldve you done ? pretty close to acceptable ( though of course many other speakers completely reject this ) . then there are also sentences like ( both heard on npr in the past week ) they never asked the right questions when they shouldve have . ( orangecounty ) or if this incident had occurred a year ago , i wouldve had been more concerned about it . ( helicopter in n . korea ) for now i will make a couple of points of my own , and next time i will respond to some previous postings , esp . frits stuurman \\'s queries . 1 ) syntactic data like these can tell us what speakers feel belong together . is the / @ v / a verb ? a preposition ? this data does n\\'t answer those questions , but does tell us that ` wouldve \\' is being interpreted as a unit that behaves like an auxiliary verb . 2 ) intuition data can be supplemented with corpus data and experimental data . for instance , in pilot elicited imitation experiments where subjects try to repeat exactly what the stimulus tape says , i am finding that modal + adverb + have sequences are much more often repeated as modal + have + adv , than modal + have + adv sequences are repeated as modal + adverb + have . this is another way to show that ` have \\' ( often pronounced / @ v / or / @ / ) is , for some speakers , dependent on the modal . as for corpus research , i have diachronic data suggesting a historical trend in this direction . i am also working on comparing synchronic spoken vs . written data . 3 ) as part of my dissertation , i \\' ve been planning to get \" expansions \" of contracted forms , like what tom cravens described , and i am getting subjects from age 4 on up to as old as i can find . so hopefully in a few months i \\' ll have some systematic data to answer some of the questions that people have raised . by the way : does anyone have a good name for this type of construction ? the best i \\' ve been able to come up with so far is \" past counterfactual \" , but i \\'d prefer a name with a more syntactic , less semantic , sense . joyce tang boyland ( jtang @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) institute of cognitive studies , uc berkeley',\n",

( i might also pronounce it as / esri lanka / ; but this is due to the fact that we do n\\'t like sequences / sc / as onsets of words . you may have already realized that if you have listened to spanish people speaking english . many of the them would say / espein / instead of / spein / ) . in argentina sri lanka is pronounced : [ siri lanka ] . the [ r ] sound is according to ipa : is a post-dental percusive sound . the [ n ] is velar . i just called my daughter who is a writer at la jornada , a local newspaper . she works in the economics section . she said that their spelling is just like english , although she supposes that some \" purist \" publications probably change the k for a c . she wrote sri lanka on a piece of paper and asked the 5 people who were in the office to pronounce it . she confirmed my own suspicion that people pronounce it as if it were in spanish - - two of them with a rather marked e at the beginning , which is what spanish phonology would require with st - , for instance . the rest of us tend to sonorize the s - , but that would be expected in mexican spanish anyway . so , her conclusion ( and mine - - we \\' re both speakers of spanish as a 1st lang ) is that it \\'s pronounced \" normally . \" she has worked with a number of argentine journalists and never noticed that they did anything worth noting , which means that they probably pronounce it just about the same . from : in % \" penaja @ wkuvx1 . wku . edu \" juan antonio pena as far as spelling , sri lanka is the spanish orthography for this asian country . as far as phonetics , the only thing worth noting is that we insert an \\' e \\' [ e ] sound at the beginning of the word sri . spanish does this with all words beginning s + any stop consonant . in spain , the name of the state is written as in english : sri lanka ( the geographical name of the island is ceilan - - with an accent on the \\' a \\' ) . the pronunciation ( in tv and broadcasting ) varies : some people says [ sri \\' lanka ] , some others [ esri \\' lanka ] ( r stands for the multiple trill of - rr - in spanish , the same sound as in perro ) . hear in spain we use to pronounce the name of the old island of ceilan in two different ways . the most common pronunciation is [ esrri lan , ka ] ( i use double r for the spanish hard r and [ n , ] for the velarized nasal sound ) . there is another pronunciation , not so common as the former : [ siri lan , ka ] . i do not know the origin of this one . so there you have it . my impression is that / esrilanka / is more common in spain , and / sirilanka / more prevalent in south america , but this is obviously not absolute . many thanks to all those who responded . marc picard',\n",

( it is obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac \\'s , but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even . i \\' m not ready to change though . i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n\\'t say whether you \\' re a mac or pc person , but the reviews of word 6 for mac were uniformly enormously negative : they actually ported woindows onto the mac ! since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully , we can\\'t imaging why they did that ! the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you are evern going to use alien scripts , there \\'s no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lots of platforms , ioncluding windows ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapters that are separate files , etc . it only is n\\'t woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 was sort of , but was buggy , and in the just-released version 5 , they abancdoned it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports , though the special fonts that come with wp ( which are true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends . ] i am in a similar situation : my new office computer came with microsoft office , which includes word . i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word , i have about abandoned the idea . the main reason , for me , is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabets , most of the ipa alphabet , characters for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , comes with hardly any of these . so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number examples or anything at all . the terminology is a bit different though , which is why i was confused . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people told me that they had gotten this to work , though they did n\\'t all know how they did it . however , after they pointed me in the right direction , i was able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by using the seq field ( look in your manual under fields ) . fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect , they have links to things like counters ( chapter number , section , number ) or dates , file names , etc . one of the fields is seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add \" ex / n \" to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex is the name or identifier for the counter , the / n is to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there are many predefined sequences , e . g . { seq chapter } refers to chapter numbers . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which does : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you \\' ve created which has the right margins , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - referencing examples : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number created in ( a ) above ( along with the parentheses ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 characters ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , \" as we saw in example \" ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operations can be simplified with macros . there are many possibilities that i have n\\'t mentioned . for instance , if you want to number the examples in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to is before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on numbering in word 2 came from : numbering examples in dos : you are right , the automatic numbering of examples in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as cross-references to examples in the text . the name of the program is renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by writing to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spaulding ave . ; los angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mailing jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have used renumber in the past , and it works well . it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for super-sophisticated searching , try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of . regarding your \\'s earch \\' question , there is a * lot * of stuff available out there , depending on the scope of your intended use . . . . if you \\' re just going for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i looked . ( just my $ 0 . 02 ) . [ powersearch seems to be pretty nice . i downloaded it from simtel ( ftp oak . oakland . edu , cd simtel / win3 / winword ( or cd simtel / win3 / wpwin ) , and get the compressed binary file powersch . zip ( or searchwp . zip ) . unfortunatel this version has the powerful features locked , and to unlock them you have to send in $ 50 , which i have not done . the search possibilities seem pretty impressive . trees huge advantage if you would make use of it is that you can easily draw trees , using the integral drawing program ( from what people say , it sounds better than arboreal ) . i keep a little file of tree-parts . reference books [ i should say that the microsoft office professional cd-rom which came wih my computer does have all the manuals in it . af first , i was n\\'t too excited about these electronic books , but now that i \\' ve gotten used to the idea , it \\'s not so bad . ] books : i have borland \\'s running word 6 . it is fairly adequate . but it does not explain about styles and templates sufficiently , to my mind ( admittedly somewhat addled ) and it does not have enough information about long documents ( master documents ) . the index is useless , until you already know what you want to find out . the help system is extensive , though again it is sometimes hard to know what to ask it . depending on your learning style , you may be quite handicapped without a real manual , but happily there are commercial versions available at most bookstores \" prima visual learning guide for word 6 . 0 \" ( prima publishing , po box 1260bk rocklin , ca 95677 ) is an example . on the other hand , it is good to get used to the on-line help , because it \\'s always there . file managers what do you want to do ? delete files ? view files ? create directories ? windows file manager , while not the best option , offers much of this function , just a mouse click away . also , try word \\'s find file command ( under the file menu ) i was real happy when i figured out how to do this one : i knew you could look at a file in wp without opening it , but i was not sure how to do this in word : here \\'s how : from the file menu , choose find file . select the file whose contents you want to view . if you do n\\'t see the file you are looking for , search for it : click on the search button , choose the drive and directory ( s ) you want to look in , make a wildcard filename ( like * . rev ) choose include subdirectories ( if you want to check your whole drive , etc ) , click on ok , and look at the list of files found . to preview the file , select preview in the view box ( still in the find file dialog box . then just click on the filename you want to look at , and you will see the first page on the screen . you can scroll through it to browse , you can delete , copy , open etc . by choosing the commands button . - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - jon aske home address : bates college 12 bardwell st . lewiston , maine 04240 , usa lewiston , maine 04240-6336 e-mail : jaske @ abacus . bates . edu - phone / fax : ( 207 ) 786-0589 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -',\n",

charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\n\\nabout 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form \\' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon \\' , ` afro - asiatic \\' , and ` dano - norwegian \\' but ` sociopolitical \\' , ` socioeconomic \\' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american \\' by the fuller form ` african american \\' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american \\' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american \\' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black \\' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate ; the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american \\' because she could n\\'t find ` afro \\' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white \\' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american \\' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american \\' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 \\'s . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire \" phenomenon \" can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of \" pristine \" etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i \\' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term \" black \" had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term \" afro - american \" , but he rejected it on the grounds that \" afro \" was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n\\'t want a term that would suggest merely \" americans who wear afro hair-do \\'s \" . \\' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african \\' to ` afro - \\' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american \\' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n\\'t consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american \\' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - \\' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac \\' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian \\' in favour of ` serbian / croatian \\' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - \\' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash \\' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience ; i am more accustomed to its usage in europe , in which it tends to connote ` cosmopolitan \\' or at least ` pan - european \\' as opposed to narrowly nationalistic . on the broader question addressed by my query , there appears to be no evidence that the morphological process of creating combining forms in - o - is itself on the way out in english ; only one or two instantiations of it are currently being rejected by some people for sociopolitical reasons . as to the past history of this process in english ( it \\'s presumably either borrowed from or heavily encouraged by greek ) , i have so far heard very little . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *',\n",

( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . there are many differences , however , between the effects of semantic satiation and \" syntactic satiation \" or judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item ( see also stromswold \\'s post below ) . judgment fatigue , in contrast , cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence . in fact , published experiments by nagata show that raters \\' intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation . second , the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue . the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it , but that individual \\'s attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence , and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost , not the ability to make sense of the utterance . third , while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established , it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees ( stromswold , snyder as cited in hudson \\'s post ) . this is not the case for semantic satiation , where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect . fourth , the \" scanting out \" effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli , not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality , with no fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items , be they open or closed class items . note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously \" great - - grammatical \" or \" horrible - - ungrammatical \" . there is a definite influence of marginality , an effect which , to date , i believe no one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( as well as perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level . this could not be the ( only ) reason for judgment fatigue , however , because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli ( such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items ) . for this reason , it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological / chemical / neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level . at this point , i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while i am not an expert on semantic satiation , i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon , but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , and one anonymous ) also observed \\' that the longer you stay in linguistics , the less you speak english . \\' to quote from bruce nevin \\'s response : < < a student was once asked , in my hearing , if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english . the reply : \\' i think he used to be . \\' > > hudson \\'s previous summation further confirms that linguists and non-linguists do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences . this type of long-term \" drift \" of linguists \\' judgments may be of interest in its own regard , but this type of \" judgment drift \" is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address . as noted by beasley and konrad , it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages , exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect , or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts ( such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as \" weak crossover \" or \" island constraints \" , for example ) may actually alter an individual \\'s criteria for grammatical acceptability . if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic type-categorizations , then one may expect that an individual \\'s discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual \\'s personal experiences with exemplars of the categories . others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . this is not the case . a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously , such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts , regardless of the concreteness of the topic , with the following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli ( which have not yet been clearly defined , but see part ii of post , following ) and by the listener \\'s / reader \\'s focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence . other individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue . some such sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , may induce confusion , but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions . for ambiguous or confusing stimuli , we say , \" someone should rewrite this sentence . it is ambiguous ( or anomalous ) . \" when we have judgment fatigue , we say , \" i \\' m a monoglot , but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical . i sure do n\\'t feel like a native english speaker ! \" lastly , some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement , and actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank you again to all who responded . if you are interested in the current proposal for my experiments , or if you would like to hear more about the results and conclusions from the experiments when i am finished running them , please contact me . please see part ii ( posted separately ) for selected quotes from respondents .',\n",

\" i quickly understood that he was no more a priest than i was , particularly when i saw him with a beautiful young girl who scarcely knew any walloon but who was determined to learn it from teachers like pierrot , like jannot , like roger , or like me ; that \\'s what he said , the fool . the passage was written by m . georges pasau , pre \\'s ident du muse \\' e de la parole au pays de bastogne ; it appeared in issue 4 ( 1994 ) of the magazine _ singuliers _ , which is devoted to walloon . this was a special number given over to the publication of a new dictionary of walloon . the dictionary is michel francard ( 1994 ) , _ dictionnaire des parlers wallons du pays de bastogne _ , brussels : deboeck / universite \\' , isbn 2-8041 - 1957 - 2 . francard is professor of romance linguistics at the university of louvain in belgium ; his address is faculte \\' des lettres , universite \\' catholique de louvain , louvain - le - nauve , belgium , and his e-mail is francard @ frwa . ucl . ac . be . i have n\\'t consulted him yet , but plan to do so . the orthography used here for walloon was , i believe , invented by francard specifically for the dictionary . the dictionary contains some nice dialect maps and some linguistic information about walloon . my thanks to jean - francois carrasco , richard coates , jean - francois delannoy , roger feron , frederik fouvry , vincent granville , ted harding , yolande meessen , philippe mennecier , bernd moebius ( and his mother ! ) , joseph reisdoerfer , thierry j . van steenberghe , guido vanden wyngaerd , and max wheeler . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk',\n",

( the drawback is that they are old recordings and do not illustrate some on-going sound changes very dramatically , particualrly the northern cities shift . ) [ i found this recording ; in addition to the american dialect passages , it contains several interesting passages comparing british and american speech . it also contains readings from old english ( \" beowulf \" ) ; middle english ( chaucer ) ; and early modern english ( shakespeare ) . the narrator \\'s dialect is itself interesting , by the way , as an example of the \" radio announcer \" dialect of the period . published in 1965 ; 33rpm format . lh ] 3 ) there are some recordings which accompany two books : timothy shopen and joseph williams , 1980 , standards and dialects in english , cambridge ma : winthrop ; and diane bryen , cheryl hartmen , and pearl tait , 1978 , variant english , columbus oh : charles merrill . both are rather more sociolinguistically than geographically oriented . the christian , linn and zuber , and linn bibliographies will give you the best coverage of what is available in american english dialect recordings ( and , nicely , how to get them ) . more better : most are free .

fortunately the \\' 501 deal \\' was more common and so it was a lot easier to figure out the meaning of the second sentence . a few people thought the 501 might be a car . this possibility had crossed our minds too . after having looked it up in a car encycopedia and having consulted a local peugeot dealer , indeed a 301 , a 401 , and a 601 , and even a 504 , turned out to exist ; a peugeot 501 , however , just does n o t exist ! so this solution had to be ruled out . the great majority of the respondents told us , that 501 refers to the popular button-fly levi \\'s blue jeans with straight legs . in holland this type of jeans is familiar also , but we did n\\'t understand the \" major used - 501 deal \" in this context : \" what \\'s the big deal in selling worn blue jeans ? \" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 \\'s in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more \\' hip \\' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 \\'s and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there \\'s a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 \\'s out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 \\'s , as rumour has it that used 501 \\'s are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 \\'s , what \\'s it all about \" 501 \\'s are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 \\'s are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi \\'s . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 \\'s are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you \\' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like \" cash for used 501 \\'s . \" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi \\'s were the prestige brand ; i do n\\'t know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . \" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal \" used 501 \\'s are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans \\' \" . witnessing a 501 deal \" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 \\'s , with \\'d eal \\' meaning \\' ( business ) transaction \\' , or \\'d eal \\' could mean \\' bargain \\' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb \\' witness \\' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . \" . cowboys like their 501 \\'s blue and stiff \" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n\\'t wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) \" . a used - 501 deal \" i \\' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for \" used 501s . \" \" 501 \" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i \\' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i \\' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i \\'d say that a \" major used - 501 deal \" is either a transaction such as the one i \\' m proposing for tomorrow or , because \" deal \" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like \" thing \" , a place of business where such transactions take place . \" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction \" \" a major used - 501 deal \" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . \" deal \" is so inarticulate a word that it \\'s not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to \" getting a good deal \" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n\\'t have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( \" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business \" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone \\'s having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for \" a major used - 501 deal \" . 1 . \" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans \" 2 . \" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand \" 3 . \" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans \" \" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition \\' to witness \\' - - at least when it means \\' to see sth . \\' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the \\' 501 deal \\' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . \" can best be paraphrased into : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi \\'s 501 . \" if someone still feels uncomfortable with this transcription , please do n\\'t hesitate to send your reaction to wimk @ zeus . cs . kun . nl . thanks again for all your contributions . many regards , wim koole , also on behalf of janny koole - loonstra nijmegen holland',\n",

( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for \" girl \" , \" boy \" , \" marry \" ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is \\' unmarked \\' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to \" generic he \" are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun \" he \" , and we must \" blame \" the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . ) \" dominated \" hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl \\'s face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to \" women and children first \" that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women \\'s power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of \" the mark \" grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote , \" only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified \" ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that \" woman \" and \" she \" are \" species \" terms which females \" have \" as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a \" species \" name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a \" genus \" designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words \" tautonyms \" ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept : \" thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _ \" . is n\\'t this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . , \" just \" a person . the jakobson book continues , \" the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item \" . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say , \" how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ? \" 3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they \\' ve had \" no concept of sex equality \" . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i \\' m somewhat sure you \\' re talking about \" rights \" . \" rights \" , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss \" women \\'s equality \" and \" men \\'s equality \" without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey',\n",

\" is a european union funded project ( copernicus \\' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak ! project , which was launched recently as a cooperation between the speech research technology laboratory of the technical university of budapest and the technical university of darmstadt ( in cooperation with gmd-ipsi ) , aims at developing such an interface for a multimedia retrieval system . at ipsi , the departments komet ( natural language generation ) and mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute to this project . the project is to construct a proof-of - concept prototype of a multimodal information system combining graphical and spoken language output in a variety of languages . the work involves four supporting goals : first , to advance the state of the art in the domains of speech synthesis , spoken text generation , and graphical interface design ; second , to provide enabling technology for higher functionality information systems that are more appropriate for general public use ; third , to significantly improve the public and industrial acceptance of speech synthesis in general and the hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within the project in particular ; and , fourth , to act as a focusing point for speech work in hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g \\' eza n \\' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401',\n",
