Greetings,

http://bit.ly/30yH6WK

which should link to:

http://spamassassin.apache.org/

should get 404:
http://tinyurl.com/qqqxxxyyyzzz


This used to have a blocked bit.ly link but bitly expires all blocked links.
This tests that any shortened link that redirects to the bit.ly blocked page will hit the rule
If bit.ly ever changes the URL of the blocked link page, this test will still pass but
the functionality will be broken for actual bit.ly blocked links
Blocked link: https://sadecodetest.page.link/bitlyblocked

# should link to https spamassassin dot apache dot org slash news dot html
https://sadecodetest.page.link/news
