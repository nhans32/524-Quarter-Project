This is release 20020904 of Wine, a free implementation of Windows on
Unix.  This is still a developers only release.  There are many bugs
and unimplemented features.  Most applications still do not work
correctly.

forget to include a ChangeLog entry.

WHAT'S NEW with Wine-20020904: (see ChangeLog for details)
	- Much improved PowerPC support.
	- More correct locale definitions.
	- Progress on the conversion of handle types to pointers.
	- Many Visio and Quicken fixes merged from Crossover.
	- Lots of bug fixes.

See the README file in the distribution for installation instructions.
