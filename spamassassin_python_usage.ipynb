HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO\\nCHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\\nDEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER\\nFORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW\\nHEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE\\nARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER\\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S\\nTREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE\\nMY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO\\nSTUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,\\nLIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON\\nTAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S\\nCHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE\\nFRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY\\nIDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND\\nCONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION\\nUNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A\\nSECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE\\nSECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM\\nKNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO\\nINDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR\\nBEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON\\n(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I\\nWANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY\\nREVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL\\nCOMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND\\nNON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT\\nEMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH\\nTHIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY\\nTHE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN\\nCONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL\\nPUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU\\nWHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND\\nALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.\\nFOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT\\nINFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX\\nNUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M.
